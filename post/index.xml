      <description>I&#39;ve installed many text formatting processors over the years, or as they are simply abbreviated with the acronyms WYSIWYG&amp;hellip;
Although many users prefer the advantages provided by a cloud stored-word processing program such as the one provided by Google, I tend to steer away from it mainly because of response time within the application.
But I&#39;m not oblivious either to the fact that the versioning control system as it was implemented by Google, is surely a breakthrough innovation among these programs, which needless to say, many of these other programs - including the one provided by Microsoft - at least the one provided for local installation - has failed to develop such a feature.</description>

      <title>Sed and Awk to Print Ranges</title>

      <description>sed and awk are very powerful tools that would yield results unlike anything else in *Nix.
Although one could certainly create constructs within say a bash script that would give it further fuel, it comes handy to have it as it&#39;s always the case: available, for even other menial tasks.
Printing a given range of lines would undoubtedly come practical during those times when simply displaying them directly by invoking the manual is proven not to be the most straightforward method.</description>

I usually have Lua looking this up for me through otf and ttf fonts, but it&#39;s been a while since I went this route.
fontconfig takes care of all font-related
fontconfigtakes care &amp;ndash; as the freedesktop.org website states to
  discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common source of configuration problems.</description>

      <description>It was odd that seemingly identical pamac installations loaded onto very similarly configured machines, were somehow behaving differently on a great many occasions.
Both pamac versions had been downloaded and configured and compiled apparently via the same procedure. Both systems also had been configured not much that different from one another. But on one of the systems, pamac would eventually return an error during the same updates.
Pamac would simply hang, egregiously stuck at either:</description>

      <description>Libalpm is the library for package management of Arch.
I found it funny that in case of any bugs the team says
 Bugs? You must be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report.
 But they&#39;re right. When it comes to package management handling, Arch offers unlike any other one out there, the quirks and perks that not even a propietary coding scheme such as Homebrew, Fink, Macports from OSX Cocoa could even think to come close during its best moments.</description>

      <description>Trying to get javaws to work without a glitch on one of the systems it was tested under, proved to be a chore.
The executable file was not being recognized in this case, which consequently led me to believe, that during the installation of the program, the path somehow had not been set by the libraries that&#39;d normally take care of it.
All the libraries for which javaws depended upon and for which it was being tested even under a different system seemed to have been installed.</description>

      <description>One of the pressing issues with Kakoune is the implementation of xclip to use the clipboard selections.
As the Kakoune Registers &amp;ndash; Clipboard Wikistates it:
 Notice that xclip will not work using this example This was one of the reasons why I wanted to delve further into this issue.
Anyhow, I&#39;ll copy-paste the various sections from the Kakoune Registers - Clipboard Wikithat show a better overview of the steps to follow by adding the snippets into the initialization file, while using xsel.</description>

      <description>Forwarding an email is a function usually bound to the f key, but if there are any Attachments that were included on the email, high chances are, that the attachments will not be selected.
One could go directly to the attachments in question and selectively open each one of them. This in turn, will select the attachments, save the body of the email that had been sent on the original email.</description>

      <description>It seemed as if there&#39;s some sort of conflict by bringing up the menu on the xterm terminal.
Ctrl+ 🖱 (rightmouse) is usually the way that one would bring the menu, but every time this was done, xterm was crashing.
After going over some of the xorg-fonts-* packages, I noticed that some of them were not installed for the X system.
Among them, xorg-fonts-misc was not installed. I proceeded to install it and the menu was brought up successfully again by the ctrlrightmouse 🖱combination.</description>

      <description>When I tried to delve further into the issue of highlighters that were used on kakoune, I was more interested on the options akin to the ones provided and which have been implemented on vim or neovim, such as e.g. showmatch, matchpairs.
On vim this is something that could be easily obtained by having for example a set showmatch on the initialization file, but on kakoune, and although this issue on githubseemed to point in the right direction, and the accompanying commentfurther specified that by having it [the function show_matching] called out by a hook directly from the configuration file, it still wouldn&#39;t quite load the add-highlighter onto the buffer.</description>

      <description>One of the features for which I personally would have a use for, would be macros recording and playback.
To read about this on the doc page for kakoune, :doc keys macros might give you an idea that by default Q starts or ends macro recording, while q replays it.
the &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt; key also ends the macro recording.
See Kakoune MacrosBut further description for the macros recording and playback, is not provided on the doc page for Kakoune.</description>

      <description>I seldom use the text editor kakoune. Many of the features that I have found with vim or neovim for that matter in the past, have finally been implemented on this editor.
It is, however, one of the best modal editors currently in development and I encourage anyone who may be interested on the modality of these sort of editors, to try it out.
I wanted to see how well this editor handled key mappings to invoke a command from within the shell.</description>

I knew that by going to Preferred Applications one would have to further specify the corresponding commands under the Mail Reader application. But although it did pointed this out by running

The markdown files in question were of the abbreviated form md and not markdown.
It did work without a problem on any newly-created file and whether these files were of the form or had the extension md or markdown.
The README file of closetag specifies that in order for the plugin to work, it should be further specified as such on the initialization file with something such as:</description>

      <description>I still don&#39;t know whether there was an old installation of Libreoffice sitting somewhere on the system. But a new fresh installation not only failed to start up but it also returned the message error Error while reinstalling all previously deployed packages of context user.
Looking up Google didn&#39;t help in finding some sort of recent info about this issue.
I also had a warning: failed to load path from javadlx which was obviously only a warning but nonetheless troublesome and problematic considering that this was just a fresh installation of Libreoffice.</description>

      <description>A slowdown on my hardware had recently made me to reconsider another display manager that would presumably improve the boot time of my system. But even after installing it, I could not see any discernible difference between these display greeters. Perhaps I had noticed it before a year or so ago when I tried it out and went ahead and enabled it on an older system. This time around though, my expectations fell short.</description>

This was of course never a problem on the other machine in which antergos-common-meta was removed a while back. For the simple reason that the update related to anything hunspell was in this particular case only for hunspell-en_US as well as hunspell-es_any but not for, and this is important to note: hunspell-en.</description>

The latter also gave me the proverbial run for the money.
Even after I thought that the network printer had be configured correctly, errors such as there was a problem processing document after printing a test page, or simply the error stating that the printer may not be connected assured me that the network printer was not being correctly identified.</description>

      <description>A while ago someone whom I came across on a technical forum was vouching so much for one of the most used/popular Linux Distributions that he/she almost gave the impression of fully endorsing the distro in question, without further proof.
I said that he/she stated it without further proof because all distributions consist of several software which make up the whole system. So it would be gullible to think that one particular distro employs Free Software while clearly stating that the rest of the license by which the distro developers go aheaad and implement it, is - as a result - within the framework of say for example, what the Free Software Foundation accepts.</description>

Anyone who would want to avoid having to go through the hassle of reinstalling and testing sane drivers under Arch Linux should look no further. The comparison wasn&#39;t done between all the Arch Linux based distributions, but Antergos is the clear winner here.
No Desktop Environment under Manjaro worked to have this driver functioning as it should have been functioning.</description>

      <description>The GUI version of pacman which runs under Antergos installed the scheduled updates as expected.
But as soon as new updates were found it just failed to install them.
In this case, after running the post installation hooks, it found a new update for one of the programs. But this time however, it failed to even initialized the transaction.
Although it could have been relatively simple to circumvent the problem by seeing through pacman itself what the error was, but just closing the pamac application, seemed all that was needed to have the problem fixed.</description>

In the latest updates by using pamac or even pacman returned the could not satisfy dependency error that was required in this case for the hunspell Spanish dictionary hunspell-es.
Thus by removing antergos-common-meta or whatever was left of it, resolved the problem, it seems that the Antergos community haven&#39;t been able to resolve some of these issues that keep coming up every now and then with the distribution.</description>

 pacman -Syyu -d --nodeps  The following commit apparently introduced the issue in the first place:</description>

      <description>During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.
Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.
this is even after running the usual mkinitcpio -p &amp;lt;linux kernel&amp;gt; that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.
It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.</description>

      <title>Udisks2 Udiskie Fares Better Than Ntfs 3g</title>

      <description>It is my opinion, based mostly not on what I’ve read, but instead on what I’ve encountered during the handling of a failed hard disk, that the disk volume mounting utility udisks2 fares better than say, ntfs-3g.
Quite possibly there could be many improvements with this software, and there is no doubt about it, but considering wear-and-tear conditions of the disk, among other considerations, and, as long as udisks2 is run without an interruption, no other mounting options utility that is currently available may be able to improve its overall performance.</description>

      <description>Further oversights around Bluetooth vulnerabilities include technical papers such as Security Risks in Bluetooth Devices, Bluetooth security threats and solutionsEven recent articles from Slashdot - BlueBorne Vulnerabilities Impact Over 5 Billion Bluetooth-Enabled Deviceshave gone on at length about it. The following paper - although unreliable since it looks more than a pamphlet from a company that advertises its products under the pretension of providing unparalleled protection - serves to confirm that regardless of its merit [this paper itsel] is worth considering the possible risks could arise as a result from the operations of bluetooth devices.</description>
