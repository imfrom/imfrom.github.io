  <h1 class="post-title">Error Bash Completion No Such File or Directory</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Jun 9, 2020</span>
  <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know where to look —- I certainly can browse the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster/bash-completion" target="_blank">repo</a> from Debian reposotiry — or where bash completion is usually installed on Debian-based distributions. It&rsquo;s been a while since I have used these kind of systems. But after all, this is irrelevant. Even as popular as it may,  not everyione uses it.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the files that comprise this program, one could see that aside from the <code>usr</code> folder, bash completion is also installed under <code>etc</code> and <code>bin</code> accordingly.</p>
<p>Bash completion allows to fill in the rest of the commands or variables that follow fora gitven executable.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Tab_completion" target="_blank">Bash autocompletion</a> for more details about its chock features&rsquo; versatility.</p>
<p>In the case of Arch, the installation does not create — unlike on Debian — the folder <code>bash_completion</code> under <code>etc</code>. And I don&rsquo;t think this may have been an oversight from the Arch team, but perhaps due to safety reasons,  this was something that was never considered in the first place.</p>
<p>Other programs have had no issue by correctly including on the script the means to have it install appropriately. But it&rsquo;s my opinion — and anyone is more than welcome to disagree with me here — that many a great number of programs have not chosen to do so or failed altogether in this regard. Hugo for example is one of them. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088" target="_blank"> destination directory</a> when this feature was added. See the commit <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088/commits/ccdf544f73dda2ff2dd8bf0407a77e21084c59e8">here.</a></p>
<p>To resolve this issue, the most viable solution is to manually add the folder, to where this error stems from, or else the message<code>Error: bash_completion.d: hugo.sh no such file or directory</code> will disallow the <code>autocomplete</code> which was added to the binaries of this  program, to come into effect.</p>
