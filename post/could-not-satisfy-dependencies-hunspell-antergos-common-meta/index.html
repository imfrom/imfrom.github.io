  <span class="post-date">Jul 18 2018</span>
  <p>It seems as if <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> has been removed
from some of the repositories.</p>

<p>In the latest updates by using pamac or even pacman returned
the <em>could not satisfy dependency</em> error that was required
in this case for the hunspell Spanish dictionary <strong>hunspell-es</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-17_23-51-16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thus by removing <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> or whatever was left
of it, resolved the problem, it seems that the Antergos
community haven&rsquo;t been able to resolve some of these issues
that keep coming up every now and then with the
distribution.</p>

<p>A Google search about this problem returned, among the
results some posts like <a
href="https://forum.antergos.com/topic/10303/cant-solve-dependencies-hunspell"
target="_blank">can&rsquo;t solve dependencies hunspell</a> which
summarised the same error message.</p>

<p>Unlike other occasions, I didn&rsquo;t read about this particular issue this time, The reason for not following up on it is due to the fact that a few days ago a dependency problem had appeared about a <code>..libso.2</code> (I can&rsquo;t remember the name of the file, this time around), but it was a file that needed to be removed before successfully continuing with the updates.</p>

<p>Hopefully the Antergos developers will be able to correct some
of these inconsistencies in an otherwise great distribution
that is based on Arch, before a greater share of users who are
fond of Arch, not only migrate to it, but fully adopt it as
the main OS in their systems.</p>

<p>Until then some of these errors and dependency satisfaction
from the packages would have to be resolved manually by the
end-users on their own.</p>
