  <h1 class="post-title">Slackware Startx Blank Screen Without Imobiledeviceglue</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Jan 18, 2022</span>
  <p>Blank screen kde plasma wayland on Slackware was the issue this time.</p>
<p>I had tried to run level 3 on slackware current kde plasma by invoking, as I had done before, <code>startx</code> on the system.</p>
<p>And with the most current slackware as of this writing, and after successfully upgrading the system, I was still unable to do so.</p>
<p>Some post dating back to 2019 <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/slackware-current-kde5-startx-failed-4175662813/">https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/slackware-current-kde5-startx-failed-4175662813/</a>  pointed to do an upgrade. Of which I had done. So this suggestion led nowhere.</p>
<p>After checking many of the issues as described on linuxquestions which resembled some of the behavior such as logging in through level 4 on sddm as this one pointed out <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/blank-screen-on-startx-for-kde-at-kernel-5-10-4-a-4175687833/page2.html">https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/blank-screen-on-startx-for-kde-at-kernel-5-10-4-a-4175687833/page2.html</a></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but noticed that not only I was unable to log in through sddm but also a message that read the following:</p>
<pre><code>The current theme can not be loaded due to the errors below, please select another theme:

file:///usr/share/sddm/themes/Breeze/Main.qml:14:1:plugin cannot be loaded for module &quot;org.kde.plasma.core&quot; cannot load library /usr/lib64/qt5/qml/org/kde/plasma/core&quot; libcorebindingsplugin.so (libimobiledevice-glue-1.0.so.0 cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
</code></pre><p>This of course served no discernible help at all, as Google quickly confirmed, a search for <code>bindingsplugin.so</code> returned unrelated results while recently, as of today, a search on Google for &lt;libcorebindingsplugin.so slackware&gt; pointed out that the solution for the problem would be to <code>slackpkg install-new</code>. But for as long as I have updated the system on Slackware, with the kernel and packages, I have always foregone from invoking, even though is technically correct after a system upgrade, such command as <code>slackpkg install-new</code>.</p>
<p>By the time I read that suggestion, which was just now as of this writing and  which was posted only a few days ago, I had already found, perhaps not as elegant, a solution to invoke <code>startx</code> successfully.</p>
<p>Somehow while invoking <strong>kwin_wayland</strong> though <code>startkwayland</code> I noticed, unlike before, that was returning the error: <code>/usr/bin/kwin_wayland: error while loading shared libraries: libimobiledevice-glue-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</code> which quickly identified the culprit.</p>
<p>Somehow the file for this shared library  was not installed. Perhaps the file was not using the same repo as the repo that was being used during  the system upgrade.</p>
<p>After installing it with <code>slackpkg install imobiledevice-glue</code> kde plasma was successfully loaded with <code>startx</code>.</p>
