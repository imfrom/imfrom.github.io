  <h1 class="post-title">Linux Market Share Pitfalls: data manipulation and non-existent ranking markers</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Jul 30, 2018</span>
  <p>A while ago someone whom I came across on a technical forum
was vouching so much for one of the most used/popular Linux
Distributions that he/she almost gave the impression of
fully endorsing the distro in question, without further
proof.</p>
<p>I said that he/she stated it without further proof because
all distributions consist of several software which make up
the whole system. So it would be gullible to think that one
particular distro employs Free Software while clearly
stating that the rest of the license by which the distro
developers go aheaad and implement it, is - as a result - within the
framework of say for example, what the Free Software
Foundation accepts.</p>
<p>This is not the case. Most Linux distros, and even more
those that are amongst the most popular, are not very clear
in their terms with the programs that the distro' s
developers include and consequently employ within it, for further mass
use. No distribution out there but only a handful of them do
this.</p>
<p>The problem that the above presents to the adoption of the Free
Software license is that many of these distributions do not uphold
licenses as they should or simply because its developers have included
other elements such as firmware nonfree blobs, or have provided
ambiguously writing in the documentation, and have offered other
methods that have provided download venues which in turn officially
endorse nonfree programs. More information about this can be seen on
the article entitled <em>Explaining Why We Don&rsquo;t Endorse Other Systems</em>
<a href="#nonfree"><sup id="nonfreeref">1</sup></a> posted on the Free
Software Foundation website.</p>
<p>So the poor statements that this user was trying to make about one of
the most popular Linux distributions at the time, could no longer hold
valid together under the license for which the Free Software
Foundation stands upon.</p>
<p>For further info about this, one could visit the Free
Software Foundation to get a glimpse at what this is about.</p>
<p>But to make matters even worse, the user who was trying to
make his silly point, brought up one if not the most
inaccurate and misleading source of Linux Market Share
measure rankings' markers out there, a website named
<strong>Distrowatch</strong> that lists the most popular GNU/Linux
distributions.</p>
<p>Which takes me to the second rant about why the above cannot be taken as an
statistical absolute. For <strong>Distrowatch</strong> is just a community driven, heavily
edited, bureaucratically biased reviewed epicenter which sits on the web  with
layers of html markup with a domain registration.  Let me emphasize once again
about its biased one sided view about the certain distros' Linux Market Share.
It is important to do so because it is almost and will always be imprecise to
measure the use of GNU/Linux distributions across the spectrum and compare
these - whether community or commercially based</p>
<ul>
<li>with many of the most heard- Operating systems without reliable methods
and just by a simple likes/preferences which in the end, is nothing more than
a preconceived notion of what distro should and should not be on the top.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of this, Distrowatch statement is vague to say the least.</p>
<p>According to <em>Stack Frames: A Look From Inside</em>, its author
said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each website has its own list of the most popular
distributions, updated on the basis of different criteria,
hence with different results. To give one example,
Linux Mint was the most popular distribution in
2013 and in the first half of 2014 according to
Distrowatch, but is ranked twelfth on the
LinuxCounter and LWN.  <a href="#stack"><sup id="stackref">2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is important because the disparity on numbers when
all the distributions are compared across LinuxCounter
<a href="#linuxcounter"><sup id="linuxcounterref">3</sup></a>
and LWN,  <a href="#lwn"><sup id="lwnref">4</sup></a>
greatly differ from the ranking on Distrowatch. The differences would
be much more profound if other websites would try to gather
these numbers as long as the list is not heavily edited or
maintained by users who manipulate this data like in the case of
Distrowatch.</p>
<p>In the case of the LWN site, the author of <em>Stack Frames: A
Look From Inside</em>, was also on the err side and may have
made some subtle mistakes with the rankings of the distros.
This may be noted with some of the inconsistencies with the
top market share of the distros in use. That is,  the
chronologically order of the distributions as it was
reflected on the book and as the author pointed out, is
certainly troublesome.  The list on LWN is enumerated
alphabetically and it does not necessarily offers numbers
that could be used as a better counter/measurement
tool/indicator/predictor in this case. It does show,
however, the mainstream distributions or the ones that have
been around the longest</p>
<ul>
<li>commercial and community based - in the computing world.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reading about this pervasive problem with the market share
of GNU/Linux programs, and the distributions that include
these programs in addition to the share of these
distributions along with the biases that are taking place in
community sites such as Distrowatch, the author of a blog on
the Medium blogging service platform said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I notice when they have an axe to grind against a
particular distribution bad reviews are allowed to flourish
but if I or others submit positive reviews they tend to get
ignored and there are more than a handful of distributions
where I have noticed that trend</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what it&rsquo;s unfortunate is that such misleading bits of information occur
nowadays, especially within the culture of the GNU/Linux Operating system which
even includes its kernel without which the vast GNU software which is comprised
of, accomplishes nothing.  But most importantly, listing it as so called &lsquo;popular&rsquo;
when most of the &lsquo;popular&rsquo; distributions do not even adhere to the Free
Software Foundation standards guidelines of Free Software.</p>
<p>The author in that blog stated that Distrowatch is biased towards
free-as-in-beer distributions, but I would disagree because I do think
the bias is there regardless whether is more commercially oriented by
which the distribution in question implements free software or not. It
is the case that community driven distros do not necessarily implement the
licenses any better than commercially based distros. But it makes no
difference in the case of this website. The users responsible to
update the counter list for the distros or in this case the distro
that should appear on the top are undoubtedly misinforming real/accurate market
share data without further repercussions. And by the looks of it, what
matters is the ad-driven commercially source of income that derives
from this data manipulation to the owner of Distrowatch.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether this GNU/Linux user that commented about how
that Linux distro fared in comparison with the rest, was aware of
these facts, but Distrowatch in general has been around for a while
and I wonder whether they have affected the objective and the goal
overall of the Free Software Foundation Guidelines.<br>
No doubt that the reviews need further revision but they&rsquo;re
doing so while promoting their own, without regard for the
particular distro and whether this is community-driven or not.</p>
<p>The Linux Distribution Timeline offers in turn the progress
of the Linux Distributions and although is a great project
on its own right, it does not undertake where all the sites
have fallen short to accomplish this difficult task of having a
better Market Share Model that tackles the Linux world.</p>
