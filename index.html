        <p>Antergos wins here. Manjaro could have done better but it
didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Anyone who would want to avoid having to go through the
hassle of reinstalling and testing sane drivers under Arch
Linux should look no further. The comparison wasn&rsquo;t done
between all the Arch Linux based distributions, but Antergos
is the clear winner here.</p>

<p>No Desktop Environment under Manjaro worked to have this
driver functioning as it should have been functioning. And
this is after trying Manjaro KDE, Manjaro XFCE, the most
popular of the bunch. Didn&rsquo;t try it with GNOME and I wasn&rsquo;t
going to waste my time with it.</p>

<p>Perhaps later versions would fared better, but this time
around it didn&rsquo;t deliver what it was expected from this
distribution. The main issue had to with the <code>invalid
argument</code> error message from programs such as <strong>gscan2pdf</strong>
and also from <strong>xsane</strong> and in identifying and picking up
the right device other than the infamous <code>Noname integrated
camera</code> that it would only identify from the list.</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-24_23-45-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After reinstalling both Manjaro KDE and the XFCE version the
problem continued in identifying the correct device.</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-25_00-17-57.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With Antergos it worked without a major issue and for that
reason alone I recommend this distribution over Manjaro.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jul 18 2018</span>
        <p>The GUI version of <strong>pacman</strong> which runs under Antergos
installed the scheduled updates as expected.</p>

<p>But as soon as new updates were found it just failed to
install them.</p>

<p>In this case, after running the post installation hooks, it
found a new update for one of the programs. But this time
however, it failed to even initialized the transaction.</p>

<p>Although it could have been relatively simple to circumvent
the problem by seeing through <strong>pacman</strong> itself what the error
was, but just closing the <strong>pamac</strong> application, seemed all
that was needed to have the problem fixed.</p>

<p>Soon after, the GUI version <strong>pamac</strong> had no further issues
to install the updates accordingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is is just a reminder not to fully rely on
<strong>pamac</strong> and used the main package manager for any Arch
based distribution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jul 18 2018</span>
        <p>It seems as if <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> has been removed
from some of the repositories.</p>

<p>In the latest updates by using pamac or even pacman returned
the <em>could not satisfy dependency</em> error that was required
in this case for the hunspell Spanish dictionary <strong>hunspell-es</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-17_23-51-16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thus by removing <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> or whatever was left
of it, resolved the problem, it seems that the Antergos
community haven&rsquo;t been able to resolve some of these issues
that keep coming up every now and then with the
distribution.</p>

<p>A Google search about this problem returned, among the
results some posts like <a
href="https://forum.antergos.com/topic/10303/cant-solve-dependencies-hunspell"
target="_blank">can&rsquo;t solve dependencies hunspell</a> which
summarised the same error message.</p>

<p>Unlike other occasions, I didn&rsquo;t read about this particular issue this time, The reason for not following up on it is due to the fact that a few days ago a dependency problem had appeared about a <code>..libso.2</code> (I can&rsquo;t remember the name of the file, this time around), but it was a file that needed to be removed before successfully continuing with the updates.</p>

<p>Hopefully the Antergos developers will be able to correct some
of these inconsistencies in an otherwise great distribution
that is based on Arch, before a greater share of users who are
fond of Arch, not only migrate to it, but fully adopt it as
the main OS in their systems.</p>

<p>Until then some of these errors and dependency satisfaction
from the packages would have to be resolved manually by the
end-users on their own.</p>

        <p>Running one of the usual updates from the pamac gui package, returned</p>

<pre><code> pamac: installing pacman (5.1.0-1) breaks dependency ‘pacman&lt;5.1

<p>I noticed that any package on the list with a dependency must be

<p>Later I checked the antergos forum to see if there was any solution.</p>

<p>The suggested workaround was to run</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 27 2018</span>
        <p>One of the drawbacks during the installation of <a href="https://antergos.com" target="_blank">Antergos Linux</a> was in identifying the keyboard layout option that was previously selected during the media installation.</p>

<p>As a result only the default variant was being used after installing the system.</p>

<p>I was able to identify the problem by going to the X window system xorg configuration file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.d/00-keyboard.conf</code> and noticing that the <strong>XkbLayout</strong> variant was not being properly identified as originally intended.</p>

<p>In my case, only one of the options had been specified correctly on the <code>00-keyboard.conf</code> file.</p>

<p>What I found odd, is that on another system, which is by the way, running the same xfce environment from Antergos, the same problem was not encountered. On the other system, only one (1) variant was used, and it had correctly identified the layout twice, but on the system which after installing the Antergos media, loaded the incorrect values, two (2) variants were set accordingly, but only one (1) layout option was identified. In my case <strong>us</strong> had been been identified once, whereas with the former no issues pertaining to this problem occurred in the first place.</p>

<p>As the wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files" target="_blank">Using X configuration files wiki</a> recommends, not to modify any of the settings manually, but let instead <strong>localectl</strong> handle it. <a href="#sample"><sup id="sampleref">1</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-usage.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course, it comes handy when there is even an example that illustrates the process by using the correct parameters. For something like:</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/00-keyboard-sample.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then something like the following <a href="#localectl"><sup id="localectlref">2</sup></a>, based on the previous example, suffices:</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-sample-usage.png" alt="" /></p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 20 2018</span>
        <p>During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.</p>

<p>Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.</p>

<p>this is even after running the usual mkinitcpio -p <linux kernel> that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.</p>

<p>It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.</p>

<p>With sudo privileges, access the file at /boot/default/grub first.</p>

<p>Therein, and lying at the bottom of the configuration file, one can find the:</p>

<pre><code>  # Uncomment to make GRUB remember the last selection. This requires to
  # set 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' above.
  #GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&quot;true&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>One could uncomment the GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&ldquo;true&rdquo; so the grub configuration file ‘remembers’ the selection.</p>

<p>Furthermore, and right on the top of the file the default chosen selection can be specified by modifying the value of 0:</p>

<p># GRUB boot loader configuration</p>

<p>GRUB_DEFAULT=0
To a 2 or 3 for the desired kernel. Which in my case, and if the LTS kernel is to be loaded instead, matched the kernel itself and the fallback for it.</p>

<p>By going this route, it no longer is necessary in specifying during the system startup, the desired kernel that one chooses to be loaded.</p>

<p>Remember after making any changes to grub, to update the configuration file by running:</p>

<p>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 16 2018</span>
        

<p>It is my opinion, based mostly not on what I’ve read, but instead on what I’ve encountered during the handling of a failed hard disk, that the disk volume mounting utility udisks2 fares better than say, ntfs-3g.</p>

<p>Quite possibly there could be many improvements with this software, and there is no doubt about it, but considering wear-and-tear conditions of the disk, among other considerations, and, as long as udisks2 is run without an interruption, no other mounting options utility that is currently available may be able to improve its overall performance.</p>

<p>If time is not a constraint, and the program is allowed to run on its own, udisks2 fares relatively better on previously loaded Windows OS partitions than any other. Of this I can attest without a doubt. The utility has been able to eventually access corrupted filesystems that would have been rendered unrecoverable otherwise</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 22 2017</span>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to remove all metadata from a file, is by invoking <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/metadata-irreversible/#exiftool"><sup id="refexiftool">1</sup></a></p>

<pre><code> $ exiftool -all= &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this has the inconvenience of providing a security risk by reversing it as well with:</p>

<pre><code> $ exiftool -pdf-update:all= &lt;file&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>which pretty much inserts the metadata back into the file:</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/exiftool-reversible-metadata-warning.png" alt=""></p>

<p>According to the author of <strong>exiftool</strong> this can be circumvented by issuing <code>qpdf --linearize &lt;file.in&gt; &lt;file.out&gt;</code>. For further info about this see:

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-dolphin-mtp-cant-open-file/">Manjaro Kde Plasma Dolphin Mtp Cant Open File</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Dec 16 2017</span>
        <p><strong>MTP</strong> implementation runs on most desktop environments without a problem. Except on KDE where it has had several problems in identifying and initializing a simple file from any of the devices that have been connected to the system, mainly through the USB port.</p>

<p>It’s really a shame that although Plasma KDE fairly supports Bluetooth protocol better than the rest of other desktop environments, it largely fails with both gwenview and its default Dolphin manager to open up files directly.</p>

<p>I have tried in a great many occasions to slither out many of these KDE errors by falsely attributing it to my lack of knowledge on its usage. But I can’t deny any longer that the system either works or it doesn’t. And one should no longer have to wait who-knows-how-long-and-when, before updates smother out its deficiencies.</p>

<p>Yes, I have tried to look up for the issue elsewhere such as as in <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=177028" target="_blank">mtp mount issues in KDE/Dolphin</a>, but many of the suggestions have not worked so far.</p>

<p>Whereas with KDE, to my amazement - because at this point of its developmental phase, one would think that it should perform better and not worse - the problems all range from mild to critical, while <strong>xfce</strong> on the other hand, these unexpected malfunctions and sudden out-of-the-blue crashes do occur but at a lesser degree, and when one of these errors undermines the stability, the errors do not necessarily affect the overall functionality.</p>

<p>I experienced and spoke at somewhat length about a <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/">manjaro kde error unknown application</a> post.</p>

<p>In the wake of recent Bluetooth vulnerabilities that have happened,<a href="#blue"><sup id="blueref">1</sup></a>  and the history behind it in which several authors have researched the issue, it makes no sense to have a whole interface that handles this protocol better than most environments and yet fails when the to-be-expected approach to handle it differently or by using the right terminology, handling it without bluetooth at all in light of everything that has happened with it, by going directly through the use of the mtp protocol that takes care of it. And the mtp is supported without a major flaw in <strong>xfce</strong>, <strong>Gnome</strong>, and others.</p>

<p>For further reading about <strong>MTP</strong>, is advised to visit the formidable wiki from Arch Linux at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MTP" target="_blank">MTP</a></p>

<p>It turns out that kio-extras is a dependency of Kde’s dolphin file manager, which apparently is partly responsible for the <code>failed to initlialize</code> error, but whichever is to be blamed in this regard, matters for as long as the user finds the KDE environment worthy to be used. In my case perhaps, the same opinion that for so long I’ve had of the software, has notably changed amid these recent problems: first with the <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/">manjaro kde error unknown application instance as highlighted earlier</a>, and now with the bluetooth problem.</p>

<p>Perhaps is worthy to revisit this desktop environment, but for now, it is in my opinion that there are better options out there from which to choose from, before having to put up with the inconsistencies and failures that have rendered the systems I have been running lately, useless in more than one occasion.</p>

        <p>It’s apparently a foolish idea to login as root from a file manager on Plasma KDE.</p>

<p>This was exactly what caused a number of problems, and among them, most notably, that I could not get past the login screen.</p>

<p>Of course, little did it matter that I installed any of the other display managers available and removed the current in use from the command line. I was still unable to get past the login screen.</p>

<p>In other words, it wasn’t just the usual <code>login failed</code> which indicates the wrong username and/or password. This was exactly the opposite, as after inputting the password for the system, since <code>login automatically</code> was disabled, the screen would fall back as if it loading the kernel again, and then without further ado, back into the login screen.</p>

<p>This feedback loop process was endless. I couldn’t but scourge on Google for some sort of information regarding the issue.</p>

<p>One of the first queries to Google was with the terms <strong>plasma kde fails to startx</strong>, although I knew that the last element of the query was not the most accurate. For one, because the <strong>X server</strong> was somehow running, or else how could I have a login screen in the first place. But almost unsurprisingly, the first result from Google was from the Arch Linux forum entitled <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=193286" target="_blank">Cannot start plasma 5</a>.</p>

<p>I tried to follow one of the recommendations and modify the last line to</p>

<pre><code> exec startkde
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/change-xinitrc-for-kde-plasma-login.png" alt=""></p>

<p>but it made no difference.</p>

<p>Perhaps on other desktop environments the change on <strong>.xinitrc</strong> was a success, but at least on Manjaro Plasma KDE, all of it was failing and I was not able to get past the login screen.</p>

<p>For example, the suggestion to modify the <strong>.xinitrc</strong> on the <strong>xfce</strong> desktop environment have proven to succeed without any major problem.</p>

<p>See for example <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147721" target="_blank">Can’t get past the login screen</a>, where modifying the <code>.xinitrc</code> was more than enough to get it started.</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/change-xinitrc-for-xfce-login.png" alt=""></p>

<p>At this point it was futile to modify any further the <strong>.xinitrc</strong> initialization file when moments before I had restarted the system, an error related to Plasma KDE had popped up on the screen:</p>

<p>A couple more errors from the main file manager Dolphin showed for example the following:</p>

<p>And also</p>

<p>At this point, after the infamous error with the <strong>kio_applicationsrc</strong>, I very well knew that the culprit of it all occurred when trying to login as root to Plasma from the Dolphin file manager.</p>

<p>Later on, after giving up the have Manjaro KDE running on the system, I found a few posts that spoke about logging in as root on the Plasma environment.</p>

<p>On the same post that for example was highlighted earlier, there is useful information as why running as root as KDE is altogether discouraged:</p>
