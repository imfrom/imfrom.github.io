        <span class="post-date">Nov 1, 2019</span>
        <p><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/libalpm.3.html">Libalpm</a> is the library for package management of Arch.</p>

<p>I found it funny that in case of any bugs the team says</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bugs? You must be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But they&rsquo;re right. When it comes to package management handling, Arch offers unlike any other one out there, the quirks and perks that not even a propietary  coding scheme such as Homebrew, Fink, Macports from OSX Cocoa could even think to come close during its best moments. This is not to illegitimize whatever accomplishments have been put together by these teams, but it&rsquo;s still disparately sub-par compared to what Arch has offered.</p>

<p>During the last kernel update there was a problem with  pamac though</p>

<p>Firing it up from the terminal was simply returning an</p>

<pre><code>error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>Which considering how lazy I&rsquo;ve become over the years, and even more so after reading articles a few years ago such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F">Is Google making us stupid</a> by Atlantic technology writer Nicholas Carr, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to gobble it up or try to leave it up to Google to offer the best match to this undesired behavior I was getting.</p>

<p>The first query by the algorithms of Google returned an issue over at <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/1087" target="_blank">yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </a></p>

<p>But thinking about it again, the issue pertained mostly to <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/" target="_blank"> aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/</a> which I&rsquo;ve never installed. Perhaps I had done it years earlier on another different system, but not on the current machines I&rsquo;ve been running.</p>

<p>The second queried result though, took me to <a href="https://rtfm.co.ua/en/arch-linux-package-query-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libalpm-so-11-2/" target="_blank"> Arch Linux: package-query: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11</a>, but as soon as I read about making a symbolic link, which the author of article rightfully pointed out that although it could be done,  is not recommended aand just plain wrong to go that route..</p>

<p>The other solution from the same article, involved reinstalling <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/package-query/" target="_blank"> aur package query</a>, but then again, I didn&rsquo;t even have package-query on that particular system&hellip;. and unfortunaetly reinstalling pamac didn&rsquo;t resolve the issue as he had stated it.</p>

<p>Downloading the newest version and configurring it later on did the trick&hellip;</p>

<p>Somehow it seemed that during the latest upgrade, the installation of  pamac, which occured during the same kereel upgrade and which it was done  by the interface itself did not go as planned&hellip;.</p>

<p>This had to be done again not only with <code>makepkg</code> but with a newer version, in order to have it running again.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Oct 10, 2019</span>
        <p>Trying to get <code>javaws</code> to work without a glitch on one of the systems it was tested under, proved to be a chore.</p>

<p>The executable file was not being recognized in this case, which consequently led me to believe, that during the installation of the program, the path somehow had not been set by the libraries that&rsquo;d normally take care of it.</p>

<p>All the libraries for which <code>javaws</code> depended upon and for which it was being tested even under a different system seemed to have been installed. This included, <strong>jdk8-openjdk..</strong> and its counterparts.</p>

<p>Apparently, during the installation, the path that had been set for <code>javaws</code> had been incorrectly identified.</p>

<p>The error read as follows:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/bin/javaws line 197: no such file or directory.

</code></pre>

<p>Upon further inspection of the line in question, is hard to pinpoint whether therein lied the problem or not&hellip;</p>

<p>Upon going ahead and after opening the <code>javaws</code> executable, I noticed that the path had been incorrectly set indeed by either some of the libraries during the initialization&hellip;. It was pointing out to a different location <strong>rather</strong> than where the files for the java environment were located instead.</p>

<p>Modifying the file in question and instructing it to open up without further ado, seemed to resolve the problem. Thus <code>java=/location/of/java/default/</code> worked without a problem.</p>

        <p>On a recent pacman upgrade, I encountered the error:</p>

<p>the solution everytime is to remove the <code>db.lck</code> from the <code>/var/lib/</code> directory and restart pacman.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/xclip-with-kakoune-making-it-work/">Xclip With Kakoune Making It Work</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Mar 25, 2019</span>
        

<p>One of the pressing issues with Kakoune is the implementation
of <code>xclip</code> to use the clipboard selections.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki/Registers---Clipboard/" target="_blank">Kakoune Registers &ndash; Clipboard Wiki</a> states it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Notice that <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/2325" target="_blank">xclip will not work using this example</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This was one of the reasons why I wanted to delve further into this issue.</p>

<p>Anyhow, I&rsquo;ll copy-paste the various sections from the <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki/Registers---Clipboard/" target="_blank">Kakoune Registers - Clipboard Wiki</a> that show a better overview of the steps to follow by adding the snippets into the initialization file, while using <code>xsel</code>. Then I will tweak around with the <code>xclip</code> features by using the three clipboards that <code>xclip</code> uses, namely, <code>p</code> (primary), <code>sec</code> (secondary), and finally <code>clip</code> for the clipboard.</p>

<p>Those are the options available by the use of <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<h3 id="using-the-system-clipboard">Using the System Clipboard</h3>

<p>You can use kakoune with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Clipboard">system clipboard tools</a> like <code>xsel</code>, <code>xclip</code> or <code>pbcopy</code>/<code>pbpaste</code></p>

<h3 id="to-yank-copy">To yank (copy)</h3>

<p><code>&lt;a-|&gt; xsel --input --clipboard &lt;ret&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code> pipes each selection through the given external filter program and ignore its output.</p>

<p>You may want to use the following hook to automate the dialog with the system clipboard, on each <code>y</code>, <code>d</code> or <code>c</code> operations:
```
      hook global NormalKey y|d|c %{ nop %sh{
              printf %s &ldquo;$kak_main_reg_dquote&rdquo; | xsel &ndash;input &ndash;clipboard
      }}</p>

<h3 id="to-paste">To paste</h3>

<p><code>! xsel --output --clipboard &lt;ret&gt;</code></p>

<p><code>!</code> inserts program output before selection while <code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code> inserts program output after selection.</p>

<p>Therefore you can add the following mappings:</p>

<h3 id="paste-before">Paste before</h3>

<p><code>map global user P '!xsel --output --clipboard&lt;ret&gt;'</code></p>

<h3 id="paste-after">Paste after</h3>

<p><code>map global user p '&lt;a-!&gt;xsel --output --clipboard&lt;ret&gt;'</code></p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-it-now">How to use it now</h3>

<ul>
<li>y/d - yank/delete using internal clipboard AND system clipboard at once</li>
<li>p   - paste from internal clipboard</li>
<li>&lt;,p&gt; - paste after from system clipboard (, is default for user mode)</li>
<li>&lt;,P&gt; - paste before from system clipboard (, is default for user mode)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-to-make-it-work-with-xclip-instead">How to make it work with Xclip instead.</h2>

<p>As I&rsquo;ve found out, and as the issue clearly showed, this is not
currently possible by using Xclip under Kakoune, except of course by mapping
a key to Normal mode and then calling out <code>xclip</code>.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt">freedesktop.org</a>  website states it, this is not a task
that can be easily done as long as different clients have different methods that make use of these <code>clipboard</code> features.</p>

<p>quoting from the <a href="https://specifications.freedesktop.org/clipboards-spec/clipboards-latest.txt">clipboards specifications freedesktop</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are two historical interpretations of the ICCCM:</p>

<p>a) use PRIMARY for mouse selection, middle mouse button paste, and
   explicit cut/copy/paste menu items (Qt 2, GNU Emacs 20)</p>

<p>b) use CLIPBOARD for the Windows-style cut/copy/paste menu items;
   use PRIMARY for the currently-selected text, even if it isn&rsquo;t
   explicitly copied, and for middle-mouse-click (Netscape, Mozilla,
   XEmacs, some GTK+ apps)</p>

<p>No one ever does anything interesting with SECONDARY as far as I can
tell.</p>

<p>The current consensus is that interpretation b) is correct. Qt 3 and
GNU Emacs 21 will use interpretation b), changing the behavior of
previous versions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it follows with:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, the ICCCM has a thing called &ldquo;cut buffers&rdquo; which most
clients no longer support.</p>

<p>There are two historical interpretations of the ICCCM:</p>

<p>a) use PRIMARY for mouse selection, middle mouse button paste, and
   explicit cut/copy/paste menu items (Qt 2, GNU Emacs 20)</p>

<p>b) use CLIPBOARD for the Windows-style cut/copy/paste menu items;
   use PRIMARY for the currently-selected text, even if it isn&rsquo;t
   explicitly copied, and for middle-mouse-click (Netscape, Mozilla,
   XEmacs, some GTK+ apps)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it summarizes it among many points with the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The correct behavior can be summarized as follows: CLIPBOARD works
just like the clipboard on Mac or Windows; it only changes on explicit
cut/copy. PRIMARY is an &ldquo;easter egg&rdquo; for expert users, regular users
can just ignore it; it&rsquo;s normally pastable only via
middle-mouse-click.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the best course of action, since <code>xclip</code> is known to be
working fine under <a href="https://vim.org">vim</a> or
<a href="https://neovim.org">neovim</a>, would be to map say in this
case, the <code>Y</code> key for yanking out operations, and the <code>P</code> key
for pasting the selection.</p>

<p>Of course, if other operations such as <code>delete</code> or <code>change</code>
as Kakoune currently employs, need to be mapped, I believe
that the keys can be assigned their own combinations.</p>

<p>We normally use the <code>clipboard</code> rather than the <code>primary</code> or
<code>secondary</code> X selections:</p>

<h2 id="to-yank-with-xclip">To yank with Xclip</h2>

<pre><code> map global normal &lt;Y&gt; ' $ xclip -select clip '
</code></pre>

<h2 id="to-paste-with-xclip">To paste with Xclip</h2>

<p>And to paste</p>

<pre><code> map global normal P '&lt;!&gt; xclip -select clip -o'
</code></pre>

<h2 id="freeing-register-on-kakoune-and-yanking-with-p">Freeing register <code>&quot;</code> on Kakoune and yanking with p</h2>

<p>The above mapping of both the <code>Y</code> or <code>P</code> key registers,
do not restrain the operations by which <code>y</code> that records the
operation to register <code>&quot;</code>  or <code>p</code> that pastes it.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s no possible way to do it with the otherwise rest of
the <code>clipboards</code> options that <code>xclip</code> uses, without further
noticing that the register <code>y</code> that is used for normal
yanking operations under Kakoune, wouldn&rsquo;t work as expected.
And neither by pastting that same register <code>&quot;</code>.</p>

        <p>Forwarding an email is a function usually  bound to the <code>f</code> key, but if there are any Attachments that were included on the email, high chances are,  that the attachments will not be selected.</p>

<p>One could go directly to the attachments in question and selectively open each one of them. This in turn, will select the attachments, save the body of the email that had been sent on the original email. To do this, one would have to further select the remainder from the list.</p>

<p>If various attachments are part of the email though, this otherwise seemingly
simple task, may be somewhat inconvenient.</p>

<p>One of the workarounds is to have <code>Esc-e</code> that uses the
current message as a template for a new one.</p>

        <p>It seemed as if there&rsquo;s some sort of conflict by bringing up the menu on the xterm terminal.</p>

<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+ 🖱 (rightmouse) is usually the way that one would bring the

<p>After going over some of the <strong>xorg-fonts-</strong>* packages, I noticed that some of
them were not installed for the X system.</p>

<p>Among them,  <strong>xorg-fonts-misc</strong> was not installed. I
proceeded to install it and the menu was brought up
successfully again by the <kbd>ctrl</kbd> rightmouse
🖱combination.</p>

<p>A bug report was properly sent out to address this issue. I don&rsquo;t recall from having this issue before, and/or when it even first appeared.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/kakoune-matching-pairs/">Kakoune Matching Pairs</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Feb 15, 2019</span>
        <p>When I tried to delve further into the issue of highlighters
that were used on kakoune, I was more interested on the
options akin to the ones provided and which have been
implemented on vim or neovim, such as e.g. showmatch,
matchpairs.</p>

<p>On vim this is something that could be easily
obtained by having for example a <code>set showmatch</code> on the
initialization file, but on kakoune, and although <a
href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1192">this
issue on github</a> seemed to
point in the right direction, and the <a
href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1192#issuecomment-277494934">accompanying
comment</a> further specified that by having it [the function
show_matching] called out by a hook directly from the configuration
file, it still wouldn&rsquo;t quite load the <code>add-highlighter</code> onto the
buffer.</p>

<p>Perhaps and one of the feasible explanations is that at the
time this issue came up, other changes may have been further
implemented from the developing side, thus preventing from
having this function working as I would have thought, and in
what seemed to be almost a basic functionality.</p>

<pre><code>  hook global WinCreate .* %{
    addhl show_matching
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Without having the above on the config file, I was able to
see from the buffer that the <code>add-highlighter</code> option would
come up without a problem, followed by <code>path/name</code> and ending
up with <code>type</code> and <code>type params</code> to be specified accordingly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, calling out both <code>addhl</code> with either <code>global</code> or
<code>window</code> or <code>buffer</code> seemed to work fine for <code>show_matching</code>
to highlight the opening and closing delimiters. On the
buffer that is, but I needed to have the changes applied
globally and soon after restarting the editor. The settings
needed to be called out directly from the <strong>kakrc</strong> file.</p>

<p>All in all, and after changing the values around to have
<code>add-highlighter</code> instead of <code>addhl</code> (although I couldn&rsquo;t
think of a valid reason), and further adding to the snippet
some values such as a <code>buffer</code> right after <code>addhl</code> instead,
I noticed all of it wouldn&rsquo;t add up. The hook had already
specified it as such.</p>

<p>The only thing left was to have <code>addhl</code> directly on the
initialization file without invoking a hook.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s exactly what I did</p>

<pre><code> addhl global\ show-matching 
</code></pre>

<p>The opening and closing pairs would highlight accordingly.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/kakoune-macros-recording-and-replay/">Kakoune Macros Recording and Replay</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Feb 6, 2019</span>
        <p>One of the features for which I personally would have a
use for, would be macros recording and playback.</p>

<p>To read about this on the doc page for <strong>kakoune</strong>, <code>:doc
keys macros</code> might give you an idea that by default <strong>Q</strong>
starts or ends macro recording, while <strong>q</strong> replays it.</p>

<p>the <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> key also ends the macro recording.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/keys.asciidoc#macros"
target="_blank">Kakoune Macros</a></p>

<p>But further description for the macros recording and
playback, is not provided on the doc page for <strong>Kakoune</strong>.</p>

<p>The author advises to consult the <code>:doc registers</code> for further
info.</p>

<p>As the doc states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Registers are named lists of text -instead of simply text- in order to interact well with multiselection. They are used for various purposes, like storing the last yanked text, or the captured groups associated with the selections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And about interacting with it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;c-r&gt;&lt;c&gt;</code>
when in insert mode or in a prompt, insert the value stored in the c register (single character)</p>

<p><code>&quot;&lt;c&gt;</code>
in normal mode, select the <c> register (single character)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But unlike <strong>vim</strong> in which a macro is replayed by preceding
the register <key> with the macro <strong>@</strong>, on <strong>kakoune</strong>, the
double quote along with register <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> must precede the macro
key, which in this case is <code>q</code> that&rsquo;s bound to the default
register <strong>@</strong></p>

<p>Ignorant of this fact, mixed with the confusion that stemmed
primarily from the habit of using a workflow from <strong>vim</strong>,
disallowed me to fully comprehend that in order to replay
the macro, the register (whatever this one may be) <strong><key></strong>
must supersede the double quote <code>&quot;</code>, followed in the end
by the default register <code>q</code> which in turn, fully replays
the specified macro.</p>

<p>After going over it, this may simply seem to have been
just an oversight on my part since such an obvious step to
record and replay the macro, is evident, but considering
I&rsquo;ve been used to <strong>vim</strong>, it was not at all clear at first,
what the steps may have been, mainly in order to replay the macro
on Normal mode. On <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Prompt</strong> mode, however,
the documentation provided all the details.</p>

<p>So to record the macro</p>

<pre><code> &quot; &lt;key&gt; Q &lt;esc&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>And to replay the macro</p>

<pre><code> &quot; &lt;key&gt; q 
</code></pre>

        <p>I seldom use the text editor
kakoune. Many of the features that I
have found with vim or neovim for that
matter in the past, have finally been
implemented on this editor.</p>

<p>It is, however, one of the best modal
editors currently in development and I
encourage anyone who may be interested on
the modality of these sort of editors,
to try it out.</p>

<p>I wanted to see how well this editor
handled key mappings to invoke a command
from within the shell.</p>

<p>The map keys doc which can be found at <a
href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/mapping.asciidoc"
target="_blank">mapping.ascii</a>
specifies that <code>map [switches] &lt;scope&gt;
&lt;mode&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;keys&gt;</code> would be the recomme
nded way to map a key to the desired
parameter.</p>

<p>Further googling about this issue, led me
to a post at <a
href="https://discuss.kakoune.com/t/how-to-execute-shell-commands-with-the-current-file-name/"
target="_blank">how
to execute shell commands with the current
filename</a> in which a user asked for a
similar configuration on the kakrc
initialization file to invoke a command
within the shell for the current buffer.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the suggested
recommendation for a latex file in this
case, would not work.</p>

<p>At the very least, the WinSetOption
variable must have a normal mode to which
the key is mapped to.</p>

<p>So the correct way to  map the key would be</p>

<pre><code> map global normal &lt;c-x&gt; ':w&lt;ret&gt; $ latex $kak_buffile'
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, <strong>ctrl</strong> and <strong>x</strong> are bound
to save the file and invoke the shell
command.</p>

<p>If other options are needed then specify
it accordingly</p>

        <span class="post-date">Feb 3, 2019</span>
        

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki/Registers---Clipboard"
target="_blank">kakoune wiki on github</a>
goes at length on some of the steps to
to follow in order to paste with the system clipboard</p>

<p>It says to in order to paste before with
<strong>xsel</strong> to</p>

<pre><code> map global user p '&lt;a-!&gt;xsel --output --clipboard&lt;ret&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>But in the case of  <strong>xclip</strong> for example,
and by reading the man pages of <strong>xclip</strong></p>

<pre><code> -selection
          specify which X selection to use, options are &quot;primary&quot; to
          use XA_PRIMARY (default), &quot;secondary&quot; for XA_SECONDARY  or
          &quot;clipboard&quot; for XA_CLIPBOARD
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code> -o, -out
          print the selection to standard out (generally for  piping
          to a file or program)
</code></pre>

<p>So in order to paste with the system
clipboard by using <strong>xclip</strong> instead,
<code>clipboard</code> from <strong>xsel</strong> would have to
be replaced with <code>selection</code> from
<strong>xclip</strong>, so something in the lines of</p>

<p><del>map global normal p &lsquo;<a-!>xclip -o -s<ret>&lsquo;</del></p>

<p>But rather something like</p>

<pre><code>   map global user p '&lt;a-!&gt;xclip -o -s &lt;ret&gt;'

   map global user P '!xclip -o -s &lt;ret&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>would suffice.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since stopped using the above since the way that
<code>xclip</code> uses many of the
<code>clipboards</code> do not seem to behave as expected under
Kakoune.</p>

<p><code>xclip</code> works without a setback under <a
href="https://www.vim.org" target="_blank">vim</a> or even <a
href="https://neovim.io" target="_blank">neovim</a>, and it
was this that led me to make <code>xclip</code> work under Kakoune.</p>
