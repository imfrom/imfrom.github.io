        <span class="post-date">Feb 6, 2019</span>
        <p>One of the features for which I personally would have a
use for, would be macros recording and playback.</p>

<p>To read about this on the doc page for <strong>kakoune</strong>, <code>:doc
keys macros</code> might give you an idea that by default <strong>Q</strong>
starts or ends macro recording, while <strong>q</strong> replays it.</p>

<p>the <code>&lt;esc&gt;</code> key also ends the macro rexoding.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/keys.asciidoc#macros"
target="_blank">Kakoune Macros</a></p>

<p>But further description for the macros recording and
playback, is not provided on the doc page for <strong>Kakoune</strong>.</p>

<p>The author advises to consult the <code>:doc registers</code> for further
info.</p>

<p>As the doc states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Registers are named lists of text -instead of simply text- in order to interact well with multiselection. They are used for various purposes, like storing the last yanked text, or the captured groups associated with the selections.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And about interacting with it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>&lt;c-r&gt;&lt;c&gt;</code>
when in insert mode or in a prompt, insert the value stored in the c register (single character)</p>

<p><code>&quot;&lt;c&gt;</code>
in normal mode, select the <c> register (single character)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But unlike <strong>vim</strong> in which a macro is replayed by preceding
the register <key> with the macro <strong>@</strong>, on <strong>kakoune</strong>, the
double quote along with register <code>&lt;key&gt;</code> must precede the macro
key, which in this case is <code>q</code> that&rsquo;s bound to the default
register <strong>@</strong></p>

<p>Ignorant of this fact, mixed with the confusion that stemmed
primarily from the habit of using a workflow from <strong>vim</strong>,
disallowed me to fully comprehend that in order to replay
the macro, the register (whatever this one may be) <strong><key></strong>
must supersede the double quote <code>&quot;</code>, followed in the end
by the default register <code>q</code> which in turn, fully replays
the specified macro.</p>

<p>After going over it, this may simply seem to have been
just an oversight on my part since such an obvious step to
record and replay the macro, is evident, but considering
I&rsquo;ve been used to <strong>vim</strong>, it was not at all clear at first,
what the steps would be, mainly in order to replay the macro
on Normal mode. On <strong>Insert</strong> and <strong>Promp</strong> mode, however,
the documentation provided all the details.</p>

<p>So to record the macro</p>

<pre><code> &quot; &lt;key&gt; Q &lt;esc&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>And to replay the macro</p>

<pre><code> &quot; &lt;key&gt; q 
</code></pre>

        <span class="post-date">Feb 5, 2019</span>
        <p>I seldom use the text editor
kakoune. Many of the features that I
have found with vim or neovim for that
matter in the past, have finally been
implemented on this editor.</p>

<p>It is, however, one of the best modal
editors currently in development and I
encourage anyone who may be interested on
the modality of these sort of editors,
to try it out.</p>

<p>I wanted to see how well this editor
handled key mappings to invoke a command
from within the shell.</p>

<p>The map keys doc which can be found at <a
href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/mapping.asciidoc"
target="_blank">mapping.ascii</a>
specifies that <code>map [switches] &lt;scope&gt;
&lt;mode&gt; &lt;key&gt; &lt;keys&gt;</code> would be the recomme
nded way to map a key to the desired
parameter.</p>

<p>Further googling about this issue, led me
to a post at <a
href="https://discuss.kakoune.com/t/how-to-execute-shell-commands-with-the-current-file-name/"
target="_blank">how
to execute shell commands with the current
filename</a> in which a user asked for a
similar configuration on the kakrc
initialization file to invoke a command
within the shell for the current buffer.</p>

<p>But unfortunately the suggested
recommendation for a latex file in this
case, would not work.</p>

<p>At the very least, the WinSetOption
variable must have a normal mode to which
the key is mapped to.</p>

<p>So the correct way to  map the key would be</p>

<pre><code> map global normal &lt;c-x&gt; ':w&lt;ret&gt; $ latex $kak_buffile'
</code></pre>

<p>In that case, <strong>ctrl</strong> and <strong>x</strong> are bound
to save the file and invoke the shell
command.</p>

<p>If other options are needed then specify
it accordingly</p>

        <span class="post-date">Feb 3, 2019</span>
        <p>The <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/wiki/Registers---Clipboard"
target="_blank">kakoune wiki on github</a>
goes at length on some of the steps to
to follow in order to paste with the system clipboard</p>

<p>It says to in order to paste before with
<strong>xsel</strong> to</p>

<pre><code> map global user p '&lt;a-!&gt;xsel --output --clipboard&lt;ret&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>But in the case of  <strong>xclip</strong> for example,
and by reading the man pages of <strong>xclip</strong></p>

<pre><code> -selection
          specify which X selection to use, options are &quot;primary&quot; to
          use XA_PRIMARY (default), &quot;secondary&quot; for XA_SECONDARY  or
          &quot;clipboard&quot; for XA_CLIPBOARD
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code> -o, -out
          print the selection to standard out (generally for  piping
          to a file or program)
</code></pre>

<p>So in order to paste with the system
clipboard by using <strong>xclip</strong> instead,
<code>clipboard</code> from <strong>xsel</strong> would have to
be replaced with <code>selection</code> from
<strong>xclip</strong>, so something in the lines of</p>

<p><del>map global normal p &lsquo;<a-!>xclip -o -s<ret>&lsquo;</del></p>

<p>But rather something like</p>

<pre><code>   map global user p '&lt;a-!&gt;xclip -o -s &lt;ret&gt;'

   map global user P '!xclip -o -s &lt;ret&gt;'
</code></pre>

<p>would suffice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Feb 1, 2019</span>
        <p>After looking at various ways to reply to an email address through mutt along with the terminal of choice, the <a href="https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/exo/preferred-applications" target="_blank">xfce docs website</a> did not provide me with all the needed details in this case.</p>

<p>I knew that by going to <strong>Preferred Applications</strong> one would have to further specify the corresponding commands under the <strong>Mail Reader</strong> application. But although it did pointed this out by running</p>

<pre><code>$ exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator mutt
</code></pre>

<p>on the terminal, this, however, does not work. The terminal of choice will not open accordingly.</p>

<p>Further queries about this problem led me to a post from the Northern Virginia Linux Users Group.</p>

<p>On this <a href="http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/033997.html" target="_blank">post</a>, one of the users pointed out that by launching, say, <strong>xterm</strong> with the <strong>-e</strong> option, this would be more than enough to open the file in question.</p>

<pre><code> exo-open --launch 'xterm -e'
</code></pre>

<p>But this is wrong, since <strong>TerminalEmulator</strong> needs to be specified.</p>

<p>On another <a href="http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/034003.html" target="_blank">post</a> closely related under the same thread, another user specified that the <strong>&ndash;launch</strong> option needed a &ldquo;category.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to find out what the category he was referring to, may be. In this case, even the already mentioned link from <a href="http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/033997.html" target="_blank">xfce docs</a> had already pointed out.</p>

<p>The man page for <a href="https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/xterm.1" target="_blank">xterm</a> says about the <strong>-e</strong> option that it will</p>

<pre><code> -e program [ arguments ... ]
 This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the xterm window. It also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither -T nor -n are given on the command line.
</code></pre>

<p>To wrap it all up, quotes are indeed needed to call out the preferred terminal - which in my case is xterm - and finally bring out the mail reader. The option <strong>-e</strong> is needed as well, along with the path to the mutt configuration file.</p>

<pre><code> exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator 'xterm mutt -f /path/to/configuration/file &quot;%s&quot;'
</code></pre>

<p>or if one is using neomutt, change the <strong>-f</strong> option accordingly to <strong>-F</strong>.</p>

<pre><code> exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator 'xterm neomutt -F /path/to/configuration/file &quot;%s&quot;'
</code></pre>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 17, 2018</span>
        <p>I coudln&rsquo;t help but noticing that the closetag plugin script for vim wasn&rsquo;t working on any of the markdown files that had been previously edited.</p>

<p>The markdown files in question were of the abbreviated form <code>md</code> and not <code>markdown</code>.</p>

<p>It did work without a problem on any newly-created file and whether these files were of the form or had the extension <code>md</code> or <code>markdown</code>.</p>

<p>The README file of <strong>closetag</strong> specifies that in order for the plugin to work, it should be further specified as such on the initialization file with something such as:</p>

<pre><code> let g:closetag_filenames = &quot;*.html, *.xhtml, *.phtml&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>etcetera. <a href="#closetagreadme"><sup id="closetagreadmeref">1</sup></a></p>

<p>At one given point I recall having <code>*.md</code>, which was more than enough for the <strong>closetag</strong> plugin to work without a problem, even with previously edited files.</p>

<p>This time around however, only having <code>*.md</code> did not remedy the problem.</p>

<p>Having <code>*.markdown</code> on the vim initialization file was necessary for the
<strong>closetag</strong> plugin to work with previously edited markdown files that held a
suffix <code>.md</code> extension</p>

<pre><code> let g:closetag_filenames = &quot;*.md, *.mardown&quot;

        <span class="post-date">Nov 26, 2018</span>
        <p>I still don&rsquo;t know whether there was an old installation of Libreoffice sitting somewhere on the system. But a new fresh installation not only failed to start up but it also returned the message error <code>Error while reinstalling all previously deployed packages of context user</code>.</p>

<p>Looking up Google didn&rsquo;t help in finding some sort of recent info about this issue.</p>

<p>I also had a <code>warning: failed to load path from javadlx</code> which was obviously only a warning but nonetheless troublesome and problematic considering that this was just a fresh installation of Libreoffice.</p>

<p>Further looking up this issue through Google led me to the forum of Arch in which a user mentioned the possibility of permission problems with the installation. The user also queried Google to find more about this issue:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Googling about the error showed some chances of being a permission problem with ~/.openoffice.org2. But I don&rsquo;t have that directory in my system, but ~/.config/.libreoffice. I would suggest you check the permissions on this directory. Mine are 766. <a href="#javadlx"><sup id="javadlxref">1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>but there was nothing out of the norm with the permissions set on the directory. But from his post it reminded me that usually the path that is set by xdg is under the <strong>xdg</strong> directory. Then again, the environment variable for it had been set correctly.</p>

<p>I decided to go ahead and backup the <code>.config/libreoffice/4</code> directory where some of the other files for libreoffice laid at.</p>

<p>Then I moved that directory with all the files to another location, following by calling out <code>libreoffice</code> which seemed to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>One of the first hits provided by Google after my first inquiry, were from the forums at the libreoffice website itself, in which one of the threads that also dealt with this issue had mentioned the same workaround that I had just used.<a href="https://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=101&t=83995" target="_blank">LO5.0 Fatal Error cannot be started</a>.<a href="#oocontextuser"><sup id="oocontextuserref">2</sup></a></p>

<p>Further queries that would shed more light about this problem, took me to a previous probable bug that was reported to the <a href="https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64606" target="_blank">documentfoundation.org</a> website. This report was opened on 2013 and closed after right around 2014. <a href="#docfoundation"><sup id="docfoundationref">3</sup></a></p>

<p>Why that bug report at the documentfoundation.org website was shortly after marked as closed, is simply beyond me.</p>

<p>The report occurred under version 5 whereas in my case, it was under version 6. And the problem is still there.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/sddm-wayland-timezone-differs-from-locale/">Sddm Wayland Timezone Differs From Locale</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Nov 2, 2018</span>
        <p>A slowdown on my hardware had recently made me to reconsider another display manager that would presumably improve the boot time of my system. But even after installing it, I could not see any discernible difference between these display greeters. Perhaps I had noticed it before a year or so ago when I tried it out and went ahead and enable it on an older system. This time around though my expectations fell short.</p>

<p>After installing <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SDDM#Configuration_GUI" target="_blank">SDDM</a>, I called out systemd to disable <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LightDM" target="_blank">LightDM</a> with</p>

<pre><code> sytemctl disable lightdm.service 
</code></pre>

<p>followed by the enabling the newly installed display manager with</p>

<pre><code> systemctl enable sddm.service
</code></pre>

<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t after rebooting the system - although at this point my faulty memory is not helping me remember whether it was a reboot or by logging out of the system, that I noticed that the timezone differed from that of the desktop environment.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was SDDM Wayland that got it right this time around and not the DE XFCE according to the locale currently in use. The timezone that SDDM picked up and hence the entry that was returned after calling out &lsquo;timedatectl&rsquo; were the same. The reasoning behind this assumption is that by calling <code>timedatectl status</code> as the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_time#Time_zone" target="_blank">Arch Wiki suggested</a>, returned indeed what was expected, albeit wrongly set at one point by me, but nonetheless correct.</p>

<pre><code> datetimectl status
</code></pre>

<p>matched SDDM clock settings. The timezone had been incorrectly set at one point.</p>

<p>Modifying the timezone accordingly seemed to have resolved the issue with:</p>

<pre><code>timedatectl set-timezone Zone/SubZone
</code></pre>

<p>All in all, some of the <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=207550" target="_blank">posts from Arch Forums</a> that were queried via Google, were slightly off topic. Some of these <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=112137" target="_blank">posts</a> for example dealt primarily with clock twelve and twenty four hour clock settings, whereas in my case it the underlying cause was primarily due with the timezone set incorrectly.</p>

<p>Further posts that came up for XFCE were also from the long-standing threads at <strong>linuxquestions.org</strong>, a site that has been around perhaps longer than any other out there related to GNU/Linux in general. This time around the <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/adjusting-the-clock-in-xfce-4175528816/" target="_blank">user was running AntiX</a>  and not systemd. The <code>timedatectl</code> is part of the latter in this case, so the suggestions aimed at <code>hwclock</code> or setting it also through <code>date</code> instead.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found that is relatively easy to mess up the time settings on the system as this question from stackexchange pointed out. See for example <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60772/i-messed-up-my-system-clock-in-arch-linux" target="_blank">I messed up my system clock in Arch Linux</a>.</p>

<p>Other questions that dealt with XFCE and not necessarily with SDDM, pretty much coincided with the <code>timedatectl</code> command. Like for example the following question that was also on <strong>stackexchange</strong> <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/296776/how-can-i-easily-change-my-time-zone-in-arch-xfce" target="_blank">How can I easily change my time-zone in Arch/Xfce</a> that I came across only later after resolving it first in my end.</p>

<p>And still, the best way and proven methodology I know of, and one which deals with the time/date issue on an Arch Linux system is by the aforementioned method outlined above. Credit where the credit is due, because all the credit goes to the <strong>Arch Wiki</strong> for making it accessible without having to read through an entire manual to resolve an outstanding problem as simple as a timezone. Although I have to acknowledge that reading <code>man</code> pages is the optimal and thorough alternative to get a deep understanding of an entire system. Nothing comes close!</p>

        <span class="post-date">Aug 28, 2018</span>
        <p>as the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV" target="_blank">ClamAV arch linux wiki</a> states, <strong>ClamAV</strong> is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPL) anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates. Because ClamAV&rsquo;s main use is on file/mail servers for Windows desktops, it primarily detects Windows viruses and malware with its built-in signatures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to update the definitions correctly is important to run first</p>

<pre><code> freshclam
</code></pre>

<p>which should then start the update</p>

<pre><code> ClamAV update process started at Tue Aug 28 01:16:43 2018

</code></pre>

<p>But then an error came up saying that:</p>

<pre><code> WARNING: Clamd was NOT notified: Can't connect to clamd through /run/clamav/clamd.ctl: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

<p>which left me unsure what could have been the issue.</p>

<p>Googling about it returned among many of the results, some as in <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/can%27t-connect-to-unix-socket-var-run-clamav-clamd-ctl-connection-refused-856847/" target="_blank">Can&rsquo;t connect to Unix socket /var/run//clamav/clamd.ctl</a>, which dealt with the issue.</p>

<p>The error here in which it deal with <strong>clamd.ctl</strong> and not with <strong>clamd.sock connect ()</strong> as it was posted on the entry entitled <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Error:_Clamd_was_NOT_notified" target="_blank">Error Clamd was not notified</a>.</p>

<p>But after running</p>

<pre><code>  freshclam
</code></pre>

<p>I had already forgotten to start/enable <code>clamav-freshclam.service</code> as outlined on the Wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Updating_database" target="_blank">ClamAV updating database</a></p>

<p>so</p>

<pre><code> systemctl start clamav-freshclam.service
 systemctl enable clamav-freshclam.service
</code></pre>

<p>Which returned:</p>

<p><code>Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/clamav-freshclam.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/clamav-freshclam.service.</code></p>

<p>Later on by calling the status of that service with</p>

<pre><code> systemctl status clamav-freshclam.service
</code></pre>

<p>returned</p>

<pre><code> Aug 28 01:23:43  systemd[1]: Started ClamAV virus database upda&gt;
 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: ClamAV update process started&gt;

 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: bytecode.cvd is up to date
</code></pre>

<p>But whether it would be necessary to enable it every time it restarts, it&rsquo;s something that I will deal with later on. I only needed it this time around to check some files, and that was the purpose of running it in the first place.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Aug 16, 2018</span>
        <p>On a different machine running the latest updates from Arch, pacman would give the error (and rightly so) that <code>hunspell-en and hunspell-en_US are in conflict</code> and <code>could not satisfy dependencies</code> followed by <code>removing hunspell-en breaks dependency hunspell-en required by **antergos-common-meta**</code>.</p>

<p>This was of course never a problem on the other machine in which <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> was removed a while back. For the simple reason that the update related to anything <strong>hunspell</strong> was in this particular case only for <strong>hunspell-en_US</strong> as well as <strong>hunspell-es_any</strong> but not for, and this is important to note: <strong>hunspell-en</strong>. The latter includes all English dictionaries for US, UK, etc.</p>

<p>So the question is how to resolve this impeding conflict during the updates? Simply by skipping the package on pacman during the updates, or simply by deselecting the packages that belong to <strong>hunspell-en_</strong> on pamac (the gui version for pacman) for which the conflict exists in the first place.</p>

<pre><code> pacman -Su IgnorePkg=hunspell-en_US
</code></pre>

<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Skip_package_from_being_upgraded" target="_blank">Skip package from being upgraded</a> on the Arch Wiki.</p>

<p>By removing <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> the first time around on this particular
as I had done a few weeks ago on the other machine, made no difference. And
that&rsquo;s the reason as to why the above is recommended. That is, by skipping the
packages in question that belong to <strong>hunspell-en_US</strong> for example first, and
then by proceeding with the updates normally seems to be the most reasonable
method.</p>

<p>Once this is done, the next step would be to remove <strong>hunspell-en</strong> which would also remove <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> by which the latter package relies on.</p>

<p>Finally, the next step would be in installing the libraries for <strong>hunspell-en_US</strong>, or <strong>hunspell-en_GB</strong>, or <strong>hunspell-en_AU</strong> or <strong>hunspell-en_CA</strong>.</p>

<p>Apparently, in the latest installation ISO image, this issue with <strong>hunspell</strong> and its dependencies has not been removed from the repositories that the installation media uses for the initial process. Which better explains as to why on the other machine which had the most recent Antergos installation, this problem was still present, whereas with the other machine in which I had removed <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> which removed <strong>hunspell-en</strong> - the one that bundles all dictionaries for the English language - was never experienced.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/setup-network-printer-ip-address-port-number/">Setup Network Printer Ip Address Port Number</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Aug 10, 2018</span>
        <p>Setting up a network printer seems not only problematic on Arch based systems, but also on Windows.</p>

<p>The latter also gave me the proverbial run for the money.</p>

<p>Even after I thought that the network printer had be configured correctly, errors such as <code>there was a problem processing document</code> after printing a test page, or simply the error stating that <code>the printer may not be connected</code> assured me that the network printer was not being correctly identified.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>ommon <strong>U</strong>nix <strong>P</strong>rinting <strong>S</strong>ervices or as its acronym that is better known for: CUPS, is without a doubt, the most reliable method to set up any printer, and especially those that depend upon a network to operate accordingly.</p>

<p>It was not the first time setting up a network printer through CUPS, but
contrary to the first time around when the printer was successfully configured
on the system, in which the ip address had to be specified, and the connection
port number of the socket was automatically picked up by CUPS, this time around
however, specifying the ip address by itself made no difference with further
configuration.</p>

<p>The printer was still not recognized.</p>

<p>I scoured Google for any relevant results that would help me troubleshoot the problem, but none of the results seemed to provide a definitive answer.</p>

<p>The Arch Linux Forums was one of the first indicators that this issue was beyond a driver problem and rather a misconfiguration with the network printer.</p>

<p>On the thread entitled <em>Printer setting cant find wireless printer</em>, a <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1605184#p1605184" target="_blank">reply provided</a> gave a couple of hints as to where to begin to troubleshot the problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your post is much too vague. What does your wireless printer advertise? You should be able to add it using its IP address in the CUPS interface like this: <a href="http://192.168.1.3">http://192.168.1.3</a>. You need to replace 192.168.1.3 by the IP of your printer and http:// could be socket:// lpd:// or something else&hellip; Maybe you also have to specify a port number like this: <a href="http://192.168.1.3:9100">http://192.168.1.3:9100</a>. If you can setup the printer in another OS (for example Windows); you might be able to find these by examining the properties of the printer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with Windows however, is that Windows itself does not provide a simple port configuration method that would have allowed me to see the ip address and the port that was currently in use.</p>

<p>This time around CUPS had already specified the ip address and the connection for the socket. But everything else for even the location had already been noted. Furthermore, I double checked it against the settings for the wireless configuration of the printer. Not solely relying on whatever configuration the display showed but also by printing out right from the printer the specifics of the configuration.</p>

<p>When I ventured out to get a glimpse through a Windows system that would allow me to double check the settings, I encountered though, an unforeseen <code>An error occurred during port configuration. This operation is not supported</code> which prevented me any further from finding out about the ip address and port number configuration.</p>

<p><img src="/images/windows-port-error-configuration.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>This however, was not expected.</p>

<p>On this question that was brought up on the stackexchange network, the user asked <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/140009/list-all-network-printers-including-ones-not-installed" target="_blank">to list all network printers (including ones not installed)</a> and although it hinted that the program <strong>lpstat</strong> with the flag <code>-a</code> was one that would undertake the task, as the user pointed out, this would not apply to those printers that have not been installed.</p>

<p>Another command that would certainly come handy is <code>lpinfo -v</code> but more than what it provided was therefore needed.</p>

<p>On another thread entitled <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer" target="_blank">linux - how do you get the name of a network printer</a> one of the comments said that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When I run the nmap command it never seems to complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer#comment836711_662485">https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer#comment836711_662485</a></p>

<p>which pretty much matches many of the issues that I have encountered with the program.</p>

<p>The only workaround with this pervasive problem of a printer that depends solely on the network, is through some sort of initial setup performed namely through a Windows system that would point it out. So by confirming the correct ip address and port numbers of the printer, would be more than enough to specify it as such on the location of the CUPS for the printer in question. Until then, and just like a user on the Arch Forums said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The problem here is that the criteria (&ldquo;Network Printer&rdquo;) is something that only makes sense to humans. Computer programs aren&rsquo;t going to have a clear sense of that idea. You might try doing a network sweep for IP addresses that successfully connect on the JetDirect port (tcp/9100). The list is still likely to be incomplete in the case of non-JetDirect printers such as desktop printers shared over SMB. – Bratchley Jun 30 &lsquo;14 at 18:16</p>
