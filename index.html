        <span class="post-date">Dec 20, 2020</span>
        <p>This could very well qualify among one of the most pesky annoyingly error messages that one could ever come across, under the X window system. Of course there are many other errors that are certainly more problematic, but the aformentioned warning is one that requires, as I&rsquo;m doing now, to write a few words about it.</p>
<p>In the past, by simply installing any of the <code>xorg-fonts-75dpi</code> and/or <code>xorg-fonts-100dpi</code> packages, would have gotten this issue resolved.</p>
<p>One could further consult similar posts under the Arch forum that inquired about this problem. See <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=21713" target=_blank>missing helvetica font</a> or also <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=189463" target="_blank">Fonts: cannot convert string… to type Fontstruct</a>, or even albeit unrelated — since this issue at this other site, was concerned under another program perhaps — on the linuxquestions forum entitled <a href="https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/error-message-regarding-fonts-in-grace-943919/" target="_blank"> Error message regarding fonts in grace</a></p>
<p>But this time around, there must have been some sort of update that most likely has breaking up the way that a non error, and consequentially working without a warning of any kind would come up under the X system.</p>
<p>Invoking <code>xlsfonts | grep helvetica</code> was not returning anything for that matter, and restarting the system a great number of times failed for not showing the error/warning and &lsquo;fixing&rsquo; the underlying issue either.</p>
<p>The only way to circumvent it this time around, was by installing the <code>adobe-base-14-fonts</code> from the AUR repositories. Something that, as I already said, never had to be include it, to have the error/warning not coming up.</p>
<p>Further resources about this package may be found at <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/adobe-base-14-fonts/">https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/adobe-base-14-fonts/</a></p>

        <span class="post-date">Jun 9, 2020</span>
        <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know where to look —- I certainly can browse the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/buster/bash-completion" target="_blank">repo</a> from Debian reposotiry — or where bash completion is usually installed on Debian-based distributions. It&rsquo;s been a while since I have used these kind of systems. But after all, this is irrelevant. Even as popular as this distro may be,  not everyone uses it.</p>
<p>A quick glance at the files that comprise this program, one could see that aside from the <code>usr</code> folder, bash completion is also installed under <code>etc</code> and <code>bin</code> accordingly.</p>
<p>Bash completion allows to fill in the rest of the commands or variables that follow for given executable.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Tab_completion" target="_blank">Bash autocompletion</a> for more details about its chock features&rsquo; versatility.</p>
<p>In the case of Arch, the installation does not create — unlike on Debian — the folder <code>bash_completion</code> under <code>etc</code>. And I don&rsquo;t think this may have been an oversight from the Arch team, but presumably and perhaps due to safety reasons,  this was something that was never considered in the first place.</p>
<p>Other programs have had no issue by correctly including on the script the means to have it install appropriately. But it&rsquo;s my opinion — and anyone is more than welcome to disagree with me here — that many a great number of programs have not chosen to do so or failed altogether in this regard. Hugo for example is one of them. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088" target="_blank"> destination directory</a> when this feature was added. See the commit <a href="https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088/commits/ccdf544f73dda2ff2dd8bf0407a77e21084c59e8" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>To resolve this issue, the most viable solution is to manually add the folder, from whence this error stems, or else the message<code>Error: bash_completion.d: hugo.sh no such file or directory</code> will disallow the <code>autocomplete</code> which was added to the binaries of this  program, to come into effect.</p>

        <p>Setting the time and date by invoking <code>hwclock --systohc</code> or by <code>hwclock --hctosys</code> should always be followed by <code>localtime</code> rather than say by <code>--utc</code> wich is the Universal Corrdinated Time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if multiple systems are to be used, it may be useful to better have the hardware clock synchronized in UTC in case that time zone and DST Daylight Savings Time come into effect.</p>
<p>Omitting appending something as simple as <code>--localtime</code> would certainly display the UTC on multiple systems under any hardware.</p>
<p>In case of any trouble setting it up afterwards may resolve the issue</p>
<pre><code>timedatectl set-timezone 
</code></pre><p>Alternatively, one may invoke:</p>
<pre><code>hwclock --set --date 'mm/dd/yyyy 00:00:00'
hwclock --hctosys --localtime

        <span class="post-date">Mar 5, 2020</span>
        <p>On a recent <a href="https://www.wps.com/linux">WPS</a> upgrade through pamac gui, there was a somewhat inconvenient <code>curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 416 </code>  error which I wasn&rsquo;t ready for,  at the time it happened.</p>
<p>All the updates had gone through any major problem, but this seemed to go on.</p>
<p>I had no issues elsewhere and with another system in which the updates went through without any setback there seemed to be no issues either.</p>
<p>Even after updating the <strong>mirrorlist</strong>, I was still facing the same problem.</p>
<p>A quick google search led me to, among the most relevant results, a post that was entitled <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/wps-office-failure-while-downloading/112800/3" target="_blank"> wps-office: failure while downloading </a>  that was brought up by the manjaro distro users to the devs - the latter group  is after all,  the one behind the <a href="https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac" target="_blank"> development of the pamac graphical interface program </a> - in which some folks pointed out the possibility of a network problem. Unlike the op issue, mine had primarily to do with an upgrade of the wps suite, and not an installation or reinstall. And also, just  as another user stated on the same forum, I had made sure that the network paralleled culprit wasn&rsquo;t preventing the upgrade of wps from happening.</p>
<p>Since wps office is provided by AUR which is the largest unofficial repository package t Arch Linux, the best course of action was to reset the upgrade through the pamac program itself.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 30, 2019</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve installed many text formatting processors over the years, or as they are simply abbreviated with the acronyms WYSIWYG&hellip;</p>
<p>Although many users prefer the advantages provided by a cloud stored-word processing program such as the one provided by Google, I tend to steer away from it mainly because of response time within the application.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m not oblivious either to the fact that the versioning control system as it was implemented by Google, is surely a breakthrough innovation among these programs, which needless to say, many of these other programs - including the one provided by Microsoft - at least the one provided for local installation  - has failed to develop such a feature.</p>
<p>For this simple implementation alone I consider it an advantage over any desktop solution.</p>
<p>But when it comes to locally installed programs,  I&rsquo;ve tried to consider the pros and cons and one way or another I&rsquo;ve always tried to install - as I said earlier - the one with the overall best response time&hellip;</p>
<p>For this reason alone - notwithstanding the license under which the program is developed and which its devs and maintainers have put it in use, and which I always encourage to go over some its terms to clarify any further ambiguity,  and also without disregarding either the proprietary background of the company Kingsoft Office, which is the one that came up with the product,  <a href="https://www.wps.com/linux">wps office for linux</a> provides almost exactly,  what a vendor such as Microsoft has been abled to successfully come up with over the years: a whole suite of spreadsheet, word processor, and presentation programs.</p>
<p>As it&rsquo;s usually the case whenever I&rsquo;m using this program, I&rsquo;ve always toggled back and forth between languages and the dictionaries in use, and even though is no less true that one could easily go directly to whatever pre-compiled version the distribution has put together for the user, to have it installed on the machine nonetheless &ndash; along with the language pack for it &ndash; , is not clearly documented. And to make this issue less straightforward than what it ought to be, the devs have modified or for a better usage of the word - have diverged over the years  as to where the destination directories for these dictionaries are to be placed under.</p>
<p>For example, at one given point in time, the company provided the download link for the language of choice by making it  available by simply clicking  directly on their website, but for one reason or another the I&rsquo;ve recently found that the link was no longer accessible.</p>
<p>As I&rsquo;ve said before, the distro would most likely have the language pack of choice available for the system.</p>
<p>But I personally didn&rsquo;t want to go this route this time around neither, and wanted instead,  to install the language pack so the program would identify it.</p>
<p>The destination for the dictionaries is not under <code>.local</code> but rather over at</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/office6/
</code></pre><p>therein another subdirectory under <code>dicts</code> aptly entitled <code>spellcheck/</code> which further shows the default language directory - which is normally <strong>en_US</strong> in this case, is the folder from which the program would first look up any relevant file to be loaded.</p>
<p>The language pack dictionary for wps-office namely provides three (3) files with the suffixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>*.dic</li>
<li>*.aff</li>
<li>*.conf</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these files must be copied over to a newly created directory under the same subdirectory <code>dicts/spellcheck</code> as it was outlined earlier.</p>
<p>Make sure the directory for which these other language files are to be put, is   either copied in its entirety - the whole directory with all the aforementioned files - or that the directory in question is indeed created from scratch&hellip; There&rsquo;s no other way around this issue, as long as wps-office identiffies and recognizes multiple dictionaries to be loaded up as soon as the program starts.</p>
<p>The filenames for all the dictionaries - whether these are from the packaged <strong>en_US</strong>, or <strong>en_GB</strong>, or <strong>es_ES</strong>, or <strong>es_MX</strong> etc all have identical names, thus:</p>
<ul>
<li>main.dic</li>
<li>main.aff</li>
<li>dict.conf</li>
</ul>
<p>comprise the <del>file</del> directory list&hellip;.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I - without trying to sound pedantic - brought up the reason as by which one must be careful,  not to simply copy over just the additional files for the other language to be used, as this could potentially <strong>overwrite</strong> the rest.</p>
<p>The other option would be by trying to <strong>rename</strong> the files &ndash; from say a hunspell installation &ndash; to <code>main.aff</code>, <code>main.dic</code>, and modifiy the contents of the file <code>dict.conf</code> respectively to the preferred  language in question.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/sed-and-awk-to-print-ranges/">Sed and Awk to Print Ranges</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Dec 27, 2019</span>
        <p><code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> are very powerful tools that would yield results unlike anything else in *Nix.</p>
<p>Although one could certainly create constructs within say a bash script that would give it further fuel, it comes handy to have it as it&rsquo;s always the case: available,  for even other menial tasks.</p>
<p>Printing a given range of lines would undoubtedly come practical during those times when simply displaying them directly by invoking the manual is proven not to be the most straightforward method.</p>
<p>So for this purpose both <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> serve me well.</p>
<p>If I were to invoke with <code>sed</code> a certain range of lines to print say from the XParseGeometry manual or from any other file on the system, filtering it out gives - as the proverbial saying goes - power for the money.</p>
<p>Yes, it helps to have the entire <code>man</code> pages on the terminal, but it wouldn&rsquo;t filter out the results as I have wanted it to. One may try by using <code>grep</code> but I wasn&rsquo;t interested this time around to use it.</p>
<p>So</p>
<pre><code>man XParseGeometry | awk 'NR==20,NR==40' 
</code></pre><p>would hence return:</p>
<pre><code>
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fheight
       fwidth    Specify the font height and width in  pixels  (increment
                 size).

       parsestring
                 Specifies the string you want to parse.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height determined.

       xadder
       yadder    Specify  additional  interior padding needed in the win‐
                 dow.

       x_return
</code></pre><p>returned what I was after..</p>
<p>With <code>sed</code> things are perhps easier, and a great many users recommend to go this route for simple tasks such as the one I usually encounter.</p>
<p>on the terminal</p>
<pre><code>man XParseGeometry | sed -n '20,40'p
</code></pre><p>would rightly return:</p>
<pre><code>
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fheight
       fwidth    Specify the font height and width in  pixels  (increment
                 size).

       parsestring
                 Specifies the string you want to parse.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height determined.

       xadder
       yadder    Specify  additional  interior padding needed in the win‐
                 dow.

       x_return
</code></pre><p>which gives me exactly what I was after&hellip;.</p>
<p>Of course, the magic of Unix doesn&rsquo;t stop there. One could further delve into even more  commands to give both <code>sed</code> and <code>awk</code> an unimaginable power for pattern searching without having to entirely <code>grep</code> it&hellip;</p>
<p>Having other simple tasks such as looking up particular pattern on a given file, is much more easier which could print out the results satisfactorily&hellip;.</p>
<p>for a given file <code>x</code></p>
<pre><code>sed -n '2,4'p &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre><p>and through <code>awk</code> a simple</p>
<pre><code>awk 'NR==&lt;range&gt;,NR==&lt;range&gt;' &lt;filename&gt;
</code></pre><p>should suffice.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 23, 2019</span>
        <p>It&rsquo;s always nice to have a &lsquo;cheat sheet&rsquo; summary of all sorts Unix to remember certain programs</p>
<p>I usually have <code>Lua</code> looking this up for me through <code>otf</code> and <code>ttf</code> fonts, but it&rsquo;s been a while since I went this route.</p>
<p><code>fontconfig </code>takes care of all font-related</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/" target="_blank">fontconfig</a> takes care &ndash; as the freedesktop.org website states to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common source of configuration problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts can be selected if fonts are missing.
identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is minimized).
efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts, while minimzing memory usage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But it does not provide any searching mechanism to look up a particular font on the system. Or at the very least not one that I&rsquo;m aware of anyway..</p>
<p>On the other hand, <code>fc-list</code> does list the fonts available on the system&hellip;</p>
<p>The only caveat is that if I were to try to get the family name of the glyph in question, <code>fc-list</code> does provide it, but I would need to further <code>grep</code> it to not get a bunch of results.</p>
<p><code>fc-list</code> is simply put:</p>
<pre><code>FC-LIST(1)                                                     FC-LIST(1)

NAME
       fc-list - list available fonts

SYNOPSIS
       fc-list  [  -vVh ] [ --verbose ] [ -f format | --format format ] [
       -q | --quiet ] [ --version ] [ --help ]
           [ pattern  [ element ... ]  ]

DESCRIPTION
       fc-list lists fonts and styles available on the system for  appli‐
       cations  using  fontconfig.   If  any elements are specified, only
       those are printed.  Otherwise family and style are printed, unless
       verbose output is requested.
</code></pre><p>a printing mechanism to list the fonts on the system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Nov 23, 2019</span>
        <p>It was odd that seemingly identical pamac installations loaded onto very similarly configured machines,  were somehow behaving differently on a great many occasions.</p>
<p>Both pamac versions had been downloaded and configured and compiled apparently via the same procedure. Both systems also had been configured not much that different from one another. But on one of the systems, pamac would eventually return an error during the same updates.</p>
<p>Pamac would simply hang, egregiously stuck at either:</p>
<pre><code>  checking inter-dependencies
</code></pre>
<p>or during</p>
<pre><code>  checking inter-conflicts
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, I could have just  dismissed all these errors and be happily content to just get rid of this nonsense by removing pamac altogether and start afresh from the official package manager, but I would have never been happy by either settling these problems through such trivialities, as long as another system, on which the very same package was installed, was not showing the same behavior.</p>
<p>Had it given me a problematic workaround at the very least - on the other system that is,  which was working flawlessly nonetheless, -there would have been no doubt that I wouldn&rsquo;t have even considered this extraneous interface to start off with, and would have gone  instead through pacman directly. Or I could have taken further steps and try to at least, file a bug report as the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#%22Failed_to_commit_transaction_(conflicting_files)%22_error" target="_blank">Arch Wiki suggests</a>. But I always liked the design idea behind this graphical interfaced package provided with its updates&rsquo; notifications, which unlike pacman that would have required to manually tweak checking for these updates.</p>
<p>But as it&rsquo;s usually the case, pacman was downright correct by identifying as closely as possible the culprit by which the system itself held <code>files already in filesystem</code>. This was clearly the case with the package <strong>gtk-doc</strong>, and somehow this conflict had to be resolved.</p>
<p>But what I don&rsquo;t know, and it&rsquo;s my mistake since I didn&rsquo;t venture out - either at the time when it first occurred -, and much less now, because it&rsquo;d be a wildly-guessing why would this be the case, that even when two systems configured alike which in turn held the same package revisions,  were somehow behaving disparagingly different.</p>
<p>I was not able to remove it [gtk-doc], by invoking pacman alone - as there was another error that disallowed me to do so. And I was simply sloppy back then, as I&rsquo;m perhaps now to single out and summarize each of the problems that had I encountered during the installation for the new version of pamac, and to to have kept  working errors&rsquo; copies handy, as this would have provided a somewhat more acceptable idea where the problem lied at.</p>
<p>I did however, tried to stay as far away as possible from manually  removing  each of the files installed by the package [gtk-doc], but unfortunately after many unsuccessful attempts to install another pamac version, this predictable painstaking process, that of having to go and remove each file owned by the package,  seemed to be the only inevitable method to circumvent this problem.</p>
<p>After going through each subsequent step during removal and by successfully reinstalling the same package over again, pamac has been working - so far - without a glitch. If it stays as such, is yet to be determined. I could no longer assure it&hellip; but it gives me pause and comfort in knowing that <code>checking inter-dependencies</code> or <code>checking file-conflcts</code> rolling hangs haven&rsquo;t returned to this annoyingly halting process.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/libalpm.3.html">Libalpm</a> is the library for package management of Arch.</p>
<p>I found it funny that in case of any bugs the team says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bugs? You must be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report.</p>

<p>But they&rsquo;re right. When it comes to package management handling, Arch offers unlike any other one out there, the quirks and perks that not even a propietary  coding scheme such as Homebrew, Fink, Macports from OSX Cocoa could even think to come close during its best moments. This is not to illegitimize whatever accomplishments have been put together by these teams, but it&rsquo;s still disparately sub-par compared to what Arch has offered.</p>

</code></pre><p>Which considering how lazy I&rsquo;ve become over the years, and even more so after reading articles a few years ago such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F">Is Google making us stupid</a> by Atlantic technology writer Nicholas Carr, I couldn&rsquo;t wait to gobble it up or try to leave it up to Google to offer the best match to this undesired behavior I was getting.</p>
<p>The first query by the algorithms of Google returned an issue over at <a href="https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/1087" target="_blank">yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory </a></p>
<p>But thinking about it again, the issue pertained mostly to <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/" target="_blank"> aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/</a> which I&rsquo;ve never installed. Perhaps I had done it years earlier on another different system, but not on the current machines I&rsquo;ve been running.</p>
<p>The second queried result though, took me to <a href="https://rtfm.co.ua/en/arch-linux-package-query-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libalpm-so-11-2/" target="_blank"> Arch Linux: package-query: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11</a>, but as soon as I read about making a symbolic link, which the author of article rightfully pointed out that although it could be done,  is not recommended and just plain wrong to go that route..</p>
<p>The other solution from the same article, involved reinstalling <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/package-query/" target="_blank"> aur package query</a>, but then again, I didn&rsquo;t even have package-query on that particular system&hellip;. and unfortunaetly reinstalling pamac didn&rsquo;t resolve the issue as he had stated it.</p>
<p>Downloading the newest version and configuring it later on did the trick&hellip;</p>
<p>Somehow it seemed that during the latest upgrade, the installation of  pamac, which occured during the same kernel upgrade and which it was done  by the interface itself did not go as planned&hellip;.</p>
<p>This had to be done again not only with <code>makepkg</code> but with a newer version, in order to have it running again.</p>

        <p>Trying to get <code>javaws</code> to work without a glitch on one of the systems it was tested under, proved to be a chore.</p>
<p>The executable file was not being recognized in this case, which consequently led me to believe, that during the installation of the program, the path somehow had not been set by the libraries that&rsquo;d normally take care of it.</p>
<p>All the libraries for which <code>javaws</code> depended upon and for which it was being tested even under a different system seemed to have been installed. This included, <strong>jdk8-openjdk..</strong> and its counterparts.</p>
<p>Apparently, during the installation, the path that had been set for <code>javaws</code> had been incorrectly identified.</p>
<p>The error read as follows:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/bin/javaws line 197: no such file or directory.

</code></pre><p>Upon further inspection of the line in question, is hard to pinpoint whether therein lied the problem or not&hellip;</p>
<p>Upon going ahead and after opening the <code>javaws</code> executable, I noticed that the path had been incorrectly set indeed by either some of the libraries during the initialization&hellip;. It was pointing out to a different location <strong>rather</strong> than where the files for the java environment were located instead.</p>
<p>Modifying the file in question and instructing it to open up without further ado, seemed to resolve the problem. Thus <code>java=/location/of/java/default/</code> worked without a problem.</p>
