        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/directory-permissions-differ-on-var-cache-pkgfile/">Directory Permissions Differ on Var Cache Pkgfile</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Aug 6, 2018</span>
        <p>During the last updates through pacman the following message came up:</p>

<pre><code> warning: directory permissions differ on /var/cache/pkgfile/
 filesystem: 775  package: 755
</code></pre>

<p>But to first understand why this came up in the first place is good to know that <code>pkgfile</code> is a tool for searching files in the official repos. <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgfile" target="_blank">pkgfile - ArchLinux wiki</a></p>

<p>It should be noted that the question as to why the <strong>pkgfile</strong> differs for the file system hierarchy and the package itself has come up before.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://github.com/falconindy/pkgfile/issues/25" target="_blank">issue</a> on Github dealt with it.</p>

<p>In the thread, one of the users reported whether it was necessary for <strong>pkgfile</strong> to create the directory if it doesn&rsquo;t exist.</p>

<p>Of course this is not the case here, but upon closer look on the pacman log it could be seen that <strong>pkgconf</strong> had just been upgraded</p>

<pre><code> upgraded pkgconf (1.5.2-1 -&gt; 1.5.3-1)
 warning: directory permissions differ on /var/cache/pkgfile/
 filesystem: 775  package: 755
</code></pre>

<p>Which suggests that right after the updates it didn&rsquo;t recreate it.</p>

<p>On the other hand <strong>pkgconf</strong> is according to the manual pages:</p>

<pre><code> pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and
 linker flags for development libraries.  This allows build
 systems to detect other dependencies and use them with the
 system toolchain.
</code></pre>

<p>see for example what the aforementioned <a href="Github https://github.com/falconindy/pkgfile/issues/25#issuecomment-227413406" target="_blank"> issue on Github</a> said about it.</p>

<p>And a quick Google search would return among many of the results, the following:</p>

<p><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=317732#p317732">https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=317732#p317732</a></p>

<p>As well as</p>

<p><a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=223190" target="_blank">this one</a> which in turn redirected to <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=218133" target="_blank">this one</a></p>

<p>With due credit to where credit is due, the following post from the Manjaro community explicitly said that it was a warning and not an error itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>xabbu 2018-06-10 21:39:39 UTC #4
directory permissions differ on &hellip;</p>

<p>This message is a warning and not an error. This is normally not a problem. It just says that the permissions of a folder in a package differ form the permissions of that folder on your system.</p>

<p>Normally this will not result in a problem, however you should change the permissions to the package defaults to avoid future problems. This message is shown every time you update this package if the permissions don’t match.</p>

<p>In your specific case, at the moment only root and members of the group locate have access to the mlocate folder. With the change to 755 everybody can access and read the content of that folder. This don’t necessary mean everybody has also read access to the files in that folder.</p>

<p>Why the package folder contains different permissions than your system folder can have several reasons. Often it is because the upstream source have changed permissions. Sometimes a developer does this on purpose. But sometimes this happens by mistake and is changed back with the next release. Also the Maintainer can change the permissions of files and folder in the build process.
And of course the user sometimes changes the permissions of a file or folder and forget about or does it to fix a problem.</p>

<p>Also please note (@jochen82 @farverio ), if you have a problem with something else start a new thread with your problem to get help with that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On another thread on the same Manjaro forums this came up:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>fhdk 2018-05-07 10:34:00 UTC #4
rrrsssttt:
directory permissions differ on /var/lib/samba/private/
filesystem: 755 package: 700
bill_t:
It means that the permissions of this directory must be set to 755 (or drwxr-xr-x).</p>

<p>Actually it means the opposite.</p>

<p>The filesystem is 755 when the package expects it to be 700.</p>

<p>So the right thing to do is to set permissions as the package expects it to be.</p>

<p>sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/samba/private/
rrrsssttt:
I want to clarify that I don’t believe I have ever touched that folder (I may have installed apps that have touched it, but I consciously never have)</p>

<p>You don’t need to. It is probably a fix since the folder mentioned is named private and as such is a folder that samba uses for stuff like certificates, keys, private keys, and so on.</p>

<p>Such folder is only accessible for the system service running samba and the service will presumably refuse to run if permissions is wrong.</p>

<p>Try that with your .gnupg folder or the .ssh folder. If permissions is world readable you will get complaints from application and some even refuses to run unless only accessible by owner aka chmod 700 ~/.ssh -R as an example.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>see <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/i-got-a-warning-after-running-the-latest-round-of-updates-im-confused-what-to-do-next/46651" target="_blank">I get a warning after running the latest round of updates</a></p>

<p>As the user on the Manjaro Forum pointed out when he/she said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actually it means the opposite</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Changing the directory permissions of the package in question in the file system with a <code>chmod 755</code> would be the best course of action for this package permission issue.</p>

<p>I think that the reason why it occurs in the first place, is due to the fact that the tool <strong>pkgfile</strong> must have administrative privileges during installation/upgrade in order to continue. That is, writing, reading and executing. But once the update has finished it no longer is necessary to keep the same permissions than before. The package no longer needs to have access to the home of the user in question.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/linux-market-share-pitfalls/">Linux Market Share Pitfalls: data manipulation and non-existent ranking markers</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Jul 30, 2018</span>
        

<p>A while ago someone whom I came across on a technical forum
was vouching so much for one of the most used/popular Linux
Distributions that he/she almost gave the impression of
fully endorsing the distro in question, without further
proof.</p>

<p>I said that he/she stated it without further proof because
all distributions consist of several software which make up
the whole system. So it would be gullible to think that one
particular distro employs Free Software while clearly
stating that the rest of the license by which the distro
developers go aheaad and implement it, is - as a result - within the
framework of say for example, what the Free Software
Foundation accepts.</p>

<p>This is not the case. Most Linux distros, and even more
those that are amongst the most popular, are not very clear
in their terms with the programs that the distro&rsquo; s
developers include and consequently employ within it, for further mass
use. No distribution out there but only a handful of them do
this.</p>

<p>The problem that the above presents to the adoption of the Free
Software license is that many of these distributions do not uphold
licenses as they should or simply because its developers have included
other elements such as firmware nonfree blobs, or have provided
ambiguously writing in the documentation, and have offered other
methods that have provided download venues which in turn officially
endorse nonfree programs. More information about this can be seen on
the article entitled <em>Explaining Why We Don&rsquo;t Endorse Other Systems</em>
<a href="#nonfree"><sup id="nonfreeref">1</sup></a> posted on the Free
Software Foundation website.</p>

<p>So the poor statements that this user was trying to make about one of
the most popular Linux distributions at the time, could no longer hold
valid together under the license for which the Free Software
Foundation stands upon.</p>

<p>For further info about this, one could visit the Free
Software Foundation to get a glimpse at what this is about.</p>

<p>But to make matters even worse, the user who was trying to
make his silly point, brought up one if not the most
inaccurate and misleading source of Linux Market Share
measure rankings&rsquo; markers out there, a website named
<strong>Distrowatch</strong> that lists the most popular GNU/Linux
distributions.</p>

<p>Which takes me to the second rant about why the above cannot be taken as an
statistical absolute. For <strong>Distrowatch</strong> is just a community driven, heavily
edited, bureaucratically biased reviewed epicenter which sits on the web  with
layers of html markup with a domain registration.  Let me emphasize once again
about its biased one sided view about the certain distros&rsquo; Linux Market Share.
It is important to do so because it is almost and will always be imprecise to
measure the use of GNU/Linux distributions across the spectrum and compare
these - whether community or commercially based
- with many of the most heard- of Operating systems without reliable methods
  and just by a simple likes/preferences which in the end, is nothing more than
  a preconceived notion of what distro should and should not be on the top.</p>

<p>Because of this, Distrowatch statement is vague to say the least.</p>

<p>According to <em>Stack Frames: A Look From Inside</em>, its author
said that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Each website has its own list of the most popular
distributions, updated on the basis of different criteria,
    hence with different results. To give one example,
    Linux Mint was the most popular distribution in
    2013 and in the first half of 2014 according to
    Distrowatch, but is ranked twelfth on the
    LinuxCounter and LWN.  <a href="#stack"><sup id="stackref">2</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this is important because the disparity on numbers when
all the distributions are compared across LinuxCounter
<a href="#linuxcounter"><sup id="linuxcounterref">3</sup></a>
and LWN <a href="#lwn"><sup id="lwnref">4</sup></a>,
greatly differ from Distrowatch. The differences would
be much more profound if other websites would try to gather
these numbers as long as the list is not edited or
maintained by users who manipulate this data like in the case of
Distrowatch.</p>

<p>In the case of the LWN site, the author of <em>Stack Frames: A
Look From Inside</em>, was also on the err side and may have
made some subtle mistakes with the rankings of the distros.
This may be noted with some of the inconsistencies with the
top market share of the distros in use. That is,  the
chronologically order of the distributions as it was
reflected on the book and as the author pointed out, is
certainly troublesome.  The list on LWN is enumerated
alphabetically and it does not necessarily offers numbers
that could be used as a better counter/measurement
tool/indicator/predictor in this case. It does show,
however, the mainstream distributions or the ones that have
been around the longest
- commercial and community based - in the computing world.</p>

<p>Reading about this pervasive problem with the market share
of GNU/Linux programs, and the distributions that include
these programs in addition to the share of these
distributions along with the biases that are taking place in
community sites such as Distrowatch, the author of a blog on
the Medium blogging service platform said that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I notice when they have an axe to grind against a
particular distribution bad reviews are allowed to flourish
but if I or others submit positive reviews they tend to get
ignored and there are more than a handful of distributions
where I have noticed that trend</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But what it&rsquo;s unfortunate is that such misleading bits of information
occur nowadays, especially within the culture of the GNU/Linux
Operating system which even includes its kernel without which the vast
GNU software accomplishes nothing.  But most importantly listing the
so called &lsquo;popular&rsquo; when most of the &lsquo;popular&rsquo; distributions do not
even adhere to the Free Software Foundation standards guidelines of
Free Software.</p>

<p>The author in that blog stated that Distrowatch is biased towards
free-as-in-beer distributions, but I would disagree because I do think
the bias is there regardless whether is more commercially oriented by
which the distribution in question implements free software or not. It
is the case that community driven do not necessarily implement the
licenses any better than commercially based distros. But it makes no
difference in the case of this website. . The users responsible to
update the counter list for the distros or in this case the distro
that should appear on the top are undoubtedly misinforming real market
share data without further repercussions. And by the looks of it, what
matters is the ad-driven commercially source of income that derives
from this data manipulation to the owner of Distrowatch.</p>

<p>I have no idea whether this GNU/Linux user that commented about how
that Linux distro fared in comparison with the rest, was aware of
these facts, but Distrowatch in general has been around for a while
and I wonder whether they have affected the objective and the goal
overall of the Free Software Foundation Guidelines.<br />
No doubt that the reviews need further revision but they&rsquo;re
doing so while promoting their own, without regard for the
particular distro and whether this is community-driven or not.</p>

<p>The Linux Distribution Timeline offers in turn the progress
of the Linux Distributions and although is a great project
on its own right, it does not undertake where all the sites
have fallen short to accomplish this difficult task of having a
better Market Share Model that tackles the Linux world.</p>

        <p>Antergos wins here. Manjaro could have done better but it
didn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Anyone who would want to avoid having to go through the
hassle of reinstalling and testing sane drivers under Arch
Linux should look no further. The comparison wasn&rsquo;t done
between all the Arch Linux based distributions, but Antergos
is the clear winner here.</p>

<p>No Desktop Environment under Manjaro worked to have this
driver functioning as it should have been functioning. And
this is after trying Manjaro KDE, Manjaro XFCE, the most
popular of the bunch. Didn&rsquo;t try it with GNOME and I wasn&rsquo;t
going to waste my time with it.</p>

<p>Perhaps later versions would fared better, but this time
around it didn&rsquo;t deliver what it was expected from this
distribution. The main issue had to with the <code>invalid
argument</code> error message from programs such as <strong>gscan2pdf</strong>
and also from <strong>xsane</strong> and in identifying and picking up
the right device other than the infamous <code>Noname integrated
camera</code> that it would only identify from the list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Screenshot_2018-07-24_23-45-03.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After reinstalling both Manjaro KDE and the XFCE version the
problem continued in identifying the correct device.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Screenshot_2018-07-25_00-17-57.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>With Antergos it worked without a major issue and for that
reason alone I recommend this distribution over Manjaro.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jul 18, 2018</span>
        <p>The GUI version of <strong>pacman</strong> which runs under Antergos
installed the scheduled updates as expected.</p>

<p>But as soon as new updates were found it just failed to
install them.</p>

<p>In this case, after running the post installation hooks, it
found a new update for one of the programs. But this time
however, it failed to even initialized the transaction.</p>

<p>Although it could have been relatively simple to circumvent
the problem by seeing through <strong>pacman</strong> itself what the error
was, but just closing the <strong>pamac</strong> application, seemed all
that was needed to have the problem fixed.</p>

<p>Soon after, the GUI version <strong>pamac</strong> had no further issues
to install the updates accordingly.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is is just a reminder not to fully rely on
<strong>pamac</strong> and used the main package manager for any Arch
based distribution.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jul 18, 2018</span>
        <p>It seems as if <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> has been removed
from some of the repositories.</p>

<p>In the latest updates by using pamac or even pacman returned
the <em>could not satisfy dependency</em> error that was required
in this case for the hunspell Spanish dictionary <strong>hunspell-es</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Screenshot_2018-07-17_23-51-16.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thus by removing <strong>antergos-common-meta</strong> or whatever was left
of it, resolved the problem, it seems that the Antergos
community haven&rsquo;t been able to resolve some of these issues
that keep coming up every now and then with the
distribution.</p>

<p>A Google search about this problem returned, among the
results some posts like <a
href="https://forum.antergos.com/topic/10303/cant-solve-dependencies-hunspell"
target="_blank">can&rsquo;t solve dependencies hunspell</a> which
summarised the same error message.</p>

<p>Unlike other occasions, I didn&rsquo;t read about this particular issue this time, The reason for not following up on it is due to the fact that a few days ago a dependency problem had appeared about a <code>..libso.2</code> (I can&rsquo;t remember the name of the file, this time around), but it was a file that needed to be removed before successfully continuing with the updates.</p>

<p>Hopefully the Antergos developers will be able to correct some
of these inconsistencies in an otherwise great distribution
that is based on Arch, before a greater share of users who are
fond of Arch, not only migrate to it, but fully adopt it as
the main OS in their systems.</p>

<p>Until then some of these errors and dependency satisfaction
from the packages would have to be resolved manually by the
end-users on their own.</p>

        <p>Running one of the usual updates from the pamac gui package, returned</p>

<pre><code> pamac: installing pacman (5.1.0-1) breaks dependency ‘pacman&lt;5.1

<p>I noticed that any package on the list with a dependency must be
unchecked before continuing.</p>

<p>Later I checked the antergos forum to see if there was any solution.</p>

<p>The suggested workaround was to run</p>

<pre><code> pacman -Syyu -d  --nodeps

        <span class="post-date">Jan 27, 2018</span>
        <p>One of the drawbacks during the installation of <a href="https://antergos.com" target="_blank">Antergos Linux</a> was in identifying the keyboard layout option that was previously selected during the media installation.</p>

<p>As a result only the default variant was being used after installing the system.</p>

<p>I was able to identify the problem by going to the X window system xorg configuration file <code>/etc/X11/xorg.d/00-keyboard.conf</code> and noticing that the <strong>XkbLayout</strong> variant was not being properly identified as originally intended.</p>

<p>In my case, only one of the options had been specified correctly on the <code>00-keyboard.conf</code> file.</p>

<p>What I found odd, is that on another system, which is by the way, running the same xfce environment from Antergos, the same problem was not encountered. On the other system, only one (1) variant was used, and it had correctly identified the layout twice, but on the system which after installing the Antergos media, loaded the incorrect values, two (2) variants were set accordingly, but only one (1) layout option was identified. In my case <strong>us</strong> had been been identified once, whereas with the former no issues pertaining to this problem occurred in the first place.</p>

<p>As the wiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files" target="_blank">Using X configuration files wiki</a> recommends, not to modify any of the settings manually, but let instead <strong>localectl</strong> handle it. <a href="#sample"><sup id="sampleref">1</sup></a></p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-usage.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Of course, it comes handy when there is even an example that illustrates the process by using the correct parameters. For something like:</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/00-keyboard-sample.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then something like the following <a href="#localectl"><sup id="localectlref">2</sup></a>, based on the previous example, suffices:</p>

<p><img src="https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-sample-usage.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Set the values as deemed applicable to the desired customization.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 20, 2018</span>
        <p>During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.</p>

<p>Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.</p>

<p>this is even after running the usual <code>mkinitcpio -p &lt;linux kernel&gt;</code> that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.</p>

<p>It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.</p>

<p>With sudo privileges, access the file at /boot/default/grub first.</p>

<p>Therein, and lying at the bottom of the configuration file, one can find the:</p>

<pre><code> # Uncomment to make GRUB remember the last selection. This requires to
 # set 'GRUB_DEFAULT=saved' above.
 #GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&quot;true&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>One could uncomment the GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&ldquo;true&rdquo; so the grub configuration file ‘remembers’ the selection.</p>

<p>Furthermore, and right on the top of the file the default chosen selection can be specified by modifying the value of 0:</p>

<p># GRUB boot loader configuration</p>

<p>GRUB_DEFAULT=0
To a 2 or 3 for the desired kernel. Which in my case, and if the LTS kernel is to be loaded instead, matched the kernel itself and the fallback for it.</p>

<p>By going this route, it no longer is necessary in specifying during the system startup, the desired kernel that one chooses to be loaded.</p>

<p>Remember after making any changes to grub, to update the configuration file by running:</p>

<p>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jan 16, 2018</span>
        

<p>It is my opinion, based mostly not on what I’ve read, but instead on what I’ve encountered during the handling of a failed hard disk, that the disk volume mounting utility udisks2 fares better than say, ntfs-3g.</p>

<p>Quite possibly there could be many improvements with this software, and there is no doubt about it, but considering wear-and-tear conditions of the disk, among other considerations, and, as long as udisks2 is run without an interruption, no other mounting options utility that is currently available may be able to improve its overall performance.</p>

<p>If time is not a constraint, and the program is allowed to run on its own, udisks2 fares relatively better on previously loaded Windows OS partitions than any other. Of this I can attest without a doubt. The utility has been able to eventually access corrupted filesystems that would have been rendered unrecoverable otherwise</p>

        <span class="post-date">Dec 22, 2017</span>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to remove all metadata from a file, is by invoking <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/metadata-irreversible/#exiftool"><sup id="refexiftool">1</sup></a></p>

<pre><code> $ exiftool -all= &lt;file&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this has the inconvenience of providing a security risk by reversing it as well with:</p>

<pre><code> $ exiftool -pdf-update:all= &lt;file&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>which pretty much inserts the metadata back into the file:</p>

<p><img src="/images/exiftool-reversible-metadata-warning.png" alt=""></p>

<p>According to the author of <strong>exiftool</strong> this can be circumvented by issuing <code>qpdf --linearize &lt;file.in&gt; &lt;file.out&gt;</code>. For further info about this see:
