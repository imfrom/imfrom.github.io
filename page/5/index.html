        <span class="post-date">Oct 19, 2017</span>
        <p>I currently have two (2) identical - or that’s what it seemed like - <strong>xfce</strong> environments on two (2) different hardware systems.</p>
<p>I always keep at hand a list of viewers and if there is any problem removing those to be found unnecessarily large or extremely light to the point of rendering them useless, I tend to check the Arch Wiki at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications" target="_blank">List of Applications</a> for a refresher on what’s available at the moment.</p>
<p>I’ve always found useful, more or less two (2), or three (3) of them, among them, with a quick copy-paste from the Arch Wiki:</p>
<p>gv — Graphical user interface for the Ghostscript interpreter that allows to view and navigate through PostScript and PDF documents.</p>
<p>ePDFView — Free lightweight PDF document viewer using the Poppler and GTK+ libraries. Development stopped.</p>
<p>qpdfview — Tabbed document viewer. It uses Poppler for PDF support, libspectre for PS support, DjVuLibre for DjVu support, CUPS for printing support and the Qt toolkit for its interface.</p>
<p>The latter, strangely enough, was behaving differently on one of the <strong>manjaro xfce</strong> systems.</p>
<p>A quick google search turned pretty much nothing, related to this issue I was having: namely, the adjustment and consequent resizing for the Settings Window.</p>
<p><img src="/images/manjaro-xfce-qpdfview-settings-box-wrong.png" width="680px" height="450px;"></p>
<p>As you can see from the image above, I was unable to get to the bottom of the window whereto I could’ve specified <strong>to cancel</strong> or <strong>apply</strong> the changes to take effect via a GUI. What use is a GUI if one can’t access the main settings of the program?</p>
<p>This took me to the wrong path in trying to modify the settings upon which the <strong>Dialog box</strong> depended on.</p>
<p>The settings for <code>qpdfview.conf</code> were found right under the <code>.conf/qpdfview/</code> directory.</p>
<p>To no avail I tried to change the settings for the</p>
<pre><code> settingsDialogSize=@Size(488 803)
</code></pre>
<p>on the <strong>qpdfview.conf</strong> file, but every single time I did so, even after changing the above size to other feasible settings, the settings window loaded the default and preconfigured values for it, rendering any change I had made earlier such as modifying the values for that <strong>settingsDialogSize</strong> onto the configuration file,  obsolete.</p>
<p>Then I gave up tweaking around with the <code>qpdfview.conf</code> file. Even after removing this file, removing <strong>qpdfview</strong> along with all poppler libraries from the system, reinstalling the program again, logging out of the system, and restarting, and logging right back in, the problem still persisted.</p>
<p>The settings window remained, remained useless for the most part - and from a GUI’s perspective.</p>
<p>Of course I could have just pressed the <strong>carriage</strong> return key on the keyboard to apply the changes, or for that matter the <strong>escape</strong> key to discard any changes, but this was just besides the point, since it defeated the purpose of having GUI applications running. I needed it to be operational.</p>
<p>I tried another venue.</p>
<p>I noticed that every single time that the program <strong>qpdfview</strong> was invoked from the command line, several errors appeared, including the most significant of the lot:</p>
<pre><code> qt5ct: using qt5ct plugin
 qt5ct: D-Bus global menu: no
 Could not load plug-in in first attempt: ""
 "The shared library was not found."
</code></pre>
<p>the second of these messages was self-explanatory. The libraries upon which qpdfview relied upon, were not recognizing or finding the plugin.</p>
<p>A quick search on google later regarding <strong>qt5ct</strong> did not provide a satisfactory explanation behind the <strong>qpdfview</strong> problem.</p>
<p>I read some of the visual methods in adjusting the settings for <strong>qt</strong> on <a href="https://www.pcsuggest.com/qt5ct-change-qt5-application-style/" target="_blank">Change Qt5 application style with qt5ct</a></p>
<p>So I started <strong>qt5ct</strong>, and I noticed that the default settings for the window was to have <strong>gtk2</strong> as the style to be loaded.</p>
<p>Then right after I had changed it to one of the other values, I had high expectations that the changes would improve the dimensions of the dialog box settings for <strong>qpdfview</strong>. But I was wrong. It made everything worse off.</p>
<p>I finally had to tweak around with the problem directly through the <code>qt5ct.conf</code> file by changing the style field. Only then the problem with <strong>qpdfview</strong> was resolved.</p>
<pre><code> [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=gtk2
</code></pre>
<p>The style value was modified to <strong>Breeze</strong>, I saved the file and exited.</p>
<p>The <strong>qt5ct.conf</strong> file should have on the Appearance the following:</p>
<pre><code> [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=Breeze
</code></pre>
<p>Right after making the changes - not even a logout was required - <strong>qpdfview</strong> dialog box dimensions were working and definitely manageable. The only glitch - if it may be rightfully called as such - was an apparent back-to-back unwanted behavior in which the whole window for the settings, was not clearly visible, but one quick maximizing drag-around-movement maneuver, fixed the annoyance once and for all.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/">Manjaro Xfce Bluetooth Problem</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Sep 29, 2017</span>
         <p>Bluetooth recognition - at least on Manjaro Xfce - has been erratic and inconsistent.</p>
<p>For no clear reason the LTS kernel and even a newer kernel have identified the hardware, while it has failed to do so in a great many occasions.</p>
<p>Many of the tweaks included reinstalling <code>bluez</code>, <code>bluez-firmware</code>, <code>bluez-libs</code>, <code>bluez-tools</code>, and <code>bluez-utils</code>.</p>
<p>Back to the drawing room and back again.</p>
<p>The bluetooth adapters were not being recognized however. And after logging out and back into the session, and even after <code>sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now</code>, nothing seemed to work.</p>
<p>The following day - to my surprise - I booted the system and it picked the bluetooth adapters without a problem.</p>
<p>It reminded me of a comment on the manjaro forum thread entitled <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/bluetooth-adapters-app-not-opening-bluetooth-manager-bluez-failed/4367/19" target="_blank">Bluetooth adapters app not opening Bluetooth Manager</a> in which one of the participants said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bluetooth support in Linux is always troublesome, even in Windows, smartphone, etc. So yeah, I think staying away from bluetooth related hardwares if you want a trouble free experience. Wireless hardwares nowadays are going towards a dedicated receiver way to handle wireless connection and that’s a better approach. Just my two cents <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/#blueref"><sup id="blueref">1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have to agree with him on that regard.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the desktop environment <strong>KDE</strong> hasn’t - I ran it for a short while and perhaps my feedback is worthless of consideration on that regard - given me the same problems than the current configuration under <strong>xfce</strong>.</p>
<p>But I never thought that the problems would persist even after the installation of a newer kernel. That is perhaps the main reason which has been drifting me away from <strong>xfce</strong> until further notice.</p>
<p>And while <strong>KDE</strong>-fanboys have come up with the slogan that <em>it grows on you</em>, <strong>xfce</strong> is perhaps a more GNU/Linux-centric configurable environment than the former. I still enjoy tweaking with its features even though its less polished than Plasma <strong>KDE</strong>. There is no question about this. <strong>KDE</strong> aims at the latest hardware, while <strong>xfce</strong> focuses on the rest. I’ve never tried to benchmark its memory and CPU consumption, but I’m almost certain it fairs much better than <strong>KDE</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether <strong>xfce</strong> will be a daily desktop environment driver running the main programs on which my workflow depends upon, it’s a question of time and how well it will handle them without a major setback.</p>
<p>Further oversights around Bluetooth vulnerabilities include technical papers such as <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.7253&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Security Risks in Bluetooth Devices</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8872/521819c79505ac20e5da8dd14f8c41eb3f07.pdf" target="_blank">Bluetooth security threats and solutions</a></p>
<p>Even recent articles from <a
href="https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/2030213/blueborne-vulnerabilities-impact-over-5-billion-bluetooth-enabled-devices"
target="_blank">Slashdot - BlueBorne Vulnerabilities Impact Over 5 Billion
Bluetooth-Enabled Devices</a> have gone on at length about it. The following
paper - although unreliable since it looks more than a pamphlet from a company
that advertises its products under the pretension of providing unparalleled
protection - serves to confirm that regardless of its merit [this paper itsel]
is worth considering the possible risks could arise as a result from the
operations of bluetooth devices.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Aug 18, 2017</span>
         <p>I haven’t read the <code>man</code> pages enough to figure out some of the parameters that play an important behavior for the full functionality of the mighty <strong>urxvt</strong>, and it was not until I read a post - which was more of a comment on the thread entitled <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=221108" target="_blank">right click paste in urxvt terminal</a> on the archlinux.org forum - when I realized that by the combination of <strong>ctrl</strong> and right mouse click would copy and paste the selected text on the X window system.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-08-18-ctrl-right-click-urxvt.png" alt=""></p>

        <p>I’ve never bothered with <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rxvt-unicode" target="_blank">urxvt</a> in the past. Perhaps was the way that dealt with the default glyph, which discouraged me from using it.</p>
<p>Later I found that the above was easily answered here at <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81746/how-can-i-get-better-looking-fonts-in-my-term" target="_blank">how can I get better looking fonts in my terminal (urxvt)</a></p>
<p>Nonetheless, the simple fact that I had to modify it directly on <code>.Xresources</code>, stopped me from doing all the necessary modifications to accomplish it.</p>
<p>Then I also found the excellent script <a href="https://github.com/majutsushi/urxvt-font-size" target="_blank">urxvt-font-size</a> which allows changing the font size on the fly.</p>
<p>The one problem I faced with this magnificent terminal was the handling of the background color.</p>
<p>Ignorant I was of the fact that although <code>.Xresources</code> is the responsible source to change the background, one must specify it, and not expect to interpret the default values of <code>xterm</code>, a different terminal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until a post which was replying to a thread opened on the Arch\Linux forums entitled <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=957150#p957150" target="_blank">rxvt-unicode font color too dark</a> which pretty much condensed what I was after, and made me feel more stupid afterward.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Aug 18, 2017</span>
        <p>A while ago, I had to set remote and master branches on a different machine.</p>
<p>The methods included setting it up through the <code>git pull</code> command. By going tis route, both the master and remote branches were consequently set and configured without a major inconvenience.</p>
<p>Recently, although I tried to replicate the same method above, I faced problems that included among many other errors, the infamous <code>error: src refspec master does not match any. error: failed to push some refs to 'origin</code></p>
<p>I wasn’t going to go through the poor method of setting up a new site and copy-paste among other files, the <code>posts</code> folder, the <code>theme</code>, the <code>config</code> files, and any other modification I had previously committed.</p>
<p>The site was being generated without a mishap, so I knew it had to do with the no less complicated <code>git</code>, since some of the errors, like the above, were clearly describing that <code>origin</code> did not match the one from the remote.</p>
<p>the necessary steps are as follow:</p>
<p>1-Remove with <code>git</code> all leftovers from the <code>public</code> folder with <code>git rm -rf public</code></p>
<p>2-Remove the <code>public</code> folder itself with <code>rm -rf.</code></p>
<p>3-Add the static site as a submodule to the master with <code>git submodule add -b master &lt;git@github.com:&lt;USERNAME&gt;/&lt;USERNAME&gt;.github.io.git public&gt;.</code></p>
<p>And that should be more than enough to have it working in no time. Push your changes and update it accordingly.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/xfce-carpalx-layout/">Xfce Carpalx Layout</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Jul 9, 2017</span>
        <p>There are many ways to add the <a href="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/" target="_blank">carpalx</a> layout to X window system on GNU/Linux.</p>
<p>The desktop environment Plasma KDE does not have that problem. One could easily add it from the <strong>Input Devices</strong> from the <strong>settings</strong> of the system.</p>
<p>If however, one is running <strong>Xfce</strong>, things are not as straightforward as one would like them to be.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this post, one can find the zip archive where the <em>carpax.xkb</em> file resides.</p>
<p>Unzip the contents and open up the README.txt to have an idea of what to copy. But there are two (2) things/caveats to remember.</p>
<p><strong>One shouldn’t modify the <em>symbols/us</em> file as it was suggested by the author</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>No need to follow Step 3 by loading the layout with setxkbmap carpalx. For one thing it will not load the default variant of the layout.</strong></p>
<p>I’m just posting the following as it currently appears on the README.txt file provided by the author.</p>
<h1 id="installation-instructions">INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Copy carpalx.xkb to your XKB symbols directory (path my differ slightly)</p>
<p>$ cp carpalx.xkb /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/carpalx</p></li>
<li><p>Add the following lines to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols.dir</p>
<p>-dp—– a——- carpalx(qgmlwb)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qgmlwy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qfmlwy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qwkrfy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qwyrfm)
–p—– a——- carpalx(tnwmlc)</p></li>
<li><p>Now it should be possible to load the layouts with, e.g.</p>
<p>$ setxkbmap carpalx                            # defaults to QGMLWB
$ setxkbmap -layout carpalx -variant qwkrfy    # to select other variants</p></li>
<li><p>The following files should also be updated:</p>
<p>/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst
/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.xml</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 id="one-better-way-to-accomplish-it">One better way to accomplish it:</h1>
<h1 id="instructions-to-follow">Instructions to follow</h1>
<ol>
<li><p>Copy indeed carpalx.xkb to the XKB symbols directory with sudo privileges</p>
<p>$ cp carpalx.xkb /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/carpalx</p></li>
<li><p>Go to <strong>/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules</strong></p>
<p>$ cd /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules</p></li>
<li><p>Once there and with sudo privileges again open <strong>evdev.lst</strong>. Add it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/edit-evdevlst.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the file <strong>edev.xml</strong> and add the variant to the list.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="/images/edit-evdevxml.png" alt=""></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Keyboard Settings</strong> of the <strong>xfce</strong> graphical environment and add it. It will show on the list as shown in the following image:</li>

        <span class="post-date">Jun 27, 2017</span>
        <p>Recientemente en <a href="http://distrowatch.com/" target="_blank">DistroWatch</a> se publicó el anuncio del lanzamiento de la última versión de <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro</a> que incluye importantes actualizaciones.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-27-manjaro-announcement.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Entre estas actualizaciones se encuentran las nuevas versiones de los instaladores gráficos tanto como <strong>thus</strong> al igual que <strong>calamares</strong>.</p>
<p>También se anuncia la fragilidad en la generación de la contraseña o la clave que tanto el programa <strong>thus</strong> como <strong>calamares</strong> emplean durante el proceso de instalación a través tanto del ya mencionado <strong>thus</strong> o de <strong>calamares</strong> que en hashtag con modo predecible se utiliza durante la creación de estas contraseñas. <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-announces-password-weakness/#shadow"><sup id="shadowref">1</sup></a></p>
<p>Las versiones más recientes de <strong>thus</strong> y de <strong>calamares</strong> no están afectadas.</p>
<p>Por lo tanto es recomendable acceder al fichero que contiene estos errores y verificar si tu sistema está afectado.</p>
<p>Primero antes que todo para recordarnos quiénes somos - si por casualidad se nos olvidó el nombre de usuario, en la terminal:</p>
<pre><code> $ whoami
</code></pre>
<p>Que nos imprime el nombre de usuario</p>
<p>Una vez con esta información y con privilegios de usuario, es decir, mediante <code>sudo</code>  accede al fichero <code>/etc/shadow</code> mediante tu editor de texto.</p>
<p>Desde la terminal selecciona uno de los siguientes:</p>
<pre><code> sudo emacs /etc/shadow 
</code></pre>
<p>o</p>
<pre><code> sudo vim /etc/shadow 
</code></pre>
<p>o</p>
<pre><code> SUDO_EDITOR=kate sudoedit /etc/shadow 
</code></pre>
<p>Ingresa tu contraseña de usuario después para leer el fichero y verificar si la contraseña necesita ser regenerada.</p>
<p>La penúltima línea del fichero comienza con tu nombre de usuario, es decir, con el valor que <code>whoami</code> devolvió anteriormente, seguido de <code>$6$</code>, pero si la penúltima línea del fichero <code>/etc/shadow</code> contiene tu nombre de usuario encerrado por dos signos <code>$</code>, entonces lo más probable es que necesitas crear nuevas contraseñas. Recuerda que tu nombre de usuario es el valor que <code>whoami</code> devolvió en la terminal. Este nombre de usuario no debe estar encerrado por los dos signos <code>$</code>.</p>
<p>Si necesitas corregir este error, y desde la terminal:</p>
<pre><code> $ passwd 
</code></pre>
<p>cuyo comando invocará</p>
<pre><code> $ Current password:
</code></pre>
<p>Necesitas ingresar tu actual contraseña, y después especificar tu nueva contraseña, lo cual generará el hashtag correcto en el fichero <code>/etc/shadow</code>.</p>
<p>Antes de cerrar el archivo <code>/etc/shadow</code> que tenía estos errores, asegúrate que <strong>root</strong> no tiene los mismos problemas que el usuario. En este caso, <strong>root</strong> es la primera línea del archivo <code>/etc/shadow</code> lo cual es más fácil de revisar.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo, si aparece:</p>
<pre><code> root: $6$ 
</code></pre>
<p>y después de ello aparece tu <code>whoami</code> encerrado entre dos signos <code>$</code>, también tienes que arreglarlo con la generación de una <code>passwd</code> para <strong>root</strong>.</p>
<p>Para acceder <strong>root</strong>:</p>
<pre><code> $ sudo su
</code></pre>
<p>que por consiguiente estarás ejerciendo todos los comandos con los máximos privilegios desde la terminal. Si por casualidad no requiere la contraseña porque por ejemplo, haz accedido anteriormente con privilegios administrativos que utilizaste para cambiar la clave de usuario, asegúrate en ingresar en la línea de comando el ya mencionado:</p>
<pre><code> # passwd 
</code></pre>
<p>el cual invocará que especifiques tu contraseña de root. Acto seguido a ello ingresa tu nueva contraseña.</p>
<p>En el caso de <strong>shadow-</strong> no hay que hacer ninguna modificación. Es decir, el fichero <strong>shadow-</strong> que es seguido de un diptongo, es un archivo de copia del original.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Jun 8, 2017</span>
          <p>During the latest Manjaro upgrade, a conflict of packages already installed on the system, was preventing to proceed with the upgrade.</p>
<p>A quick search on Google returned among the results, a post which had recently been opened on the archlinux forum with the title <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=226723" target="_blank">conflict with gcc-libs and gcc-libs-multilib</a></p>
<p>Even though the conflict of packages on my system, was not the same conflict than the ones reported on the archlinux forum such as with the package gcc-fortran, it was clear as a user suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gcc-*-multilib is all or nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On my system, querying the database for <code>gcc</code> with <code>pacman -Qs gcc</code> returned:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-06-08-gcc-gcc-multilib-conflict.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was missing <strong>gcc-libs</strong>, while <strong>gcc-libs-multilib</strong> was installed instead.</p>
<p>A quick <code>pacman -Ss gcc</code> query - see <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Querying_package_databases" target="_blank">archlinux wiki - Querying package databases</a> would show the <strong>gcc-multilib</strong> and its accompanying files for the package <strong>gcc-libs-multilib</strong>:</p>

<p>What I ended up doing to avoid the conflict and proceed with the upgrade as scheduled, was to remove the old version of <strong>gcc</strong> - 6.8 if I’m not mistaken now, although I can always check the revision history for the exact number of the package I had at the time - and reinstall <strong>gcc</strong>. I figured to do that, since for one, I had to install the newest version for the compiler anyways, and once done with the system upgrade, then the package <strong>gcc</strong> would be reinstalled.</p>
<p>A final <code>pacman -Qs gcc</code> would return:</p>

        <span class="post-date">May 22, 2017</span>
        <p>I had configured Manjaro under an old system and was never pressed with the issue of suspend on that old hardware.</p>
<p>When the Gigabyte computer was finally up and running, I noticed that the system was unable to suspend or sleep.</p>
<p>After failing to find a quick solution to the problem on the archlinux forums, I came across this post from the Manjaro site: <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-not-waking-from-suspend-or-sleep/492" target="_blank">Manjaro not waking from suspend or sleep</a> and I almost knew  - not right away - that the discussion was the underlying cause of the problems I was experiencing.</p>
<p>One of the users, by the handle of <em>artoo</em> offered to downgrade the kernel:</p>
<p><img src="/images/2017-05-22-artoo-downgrade-suggestion.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The kernel number and the year of the post were no longer relevant.</p>
<p>But instead of the solution offered by the user <strong>artoo</strong> in downgrading, I chose to upgrade instead, especially after the reply by another user who said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its likeley the problem with hooks in mkinitcpio.conf and users having to
manually mkinitcpio -p linux. Its a weekeley problem on irc and this fixes most
oftenly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Its very likely I assumed the initramfs get rebuild one way or another.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/2017-05-22-ivan-reply-mkinitcpiio.png" alt=""></p>
<p>And the anecdote example almost a month later by another user in which he said that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This time execution of mkinitcpio -p linux46 turns out to be sufficient</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/firefox-problem-with-xclip/">Firefox Problem With Xclip</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">May 20, 2017</span>
        <p>I’ve used both vim and neovim editors. The latter is just the newest implementation with out of the box pre-configurations.</p>
<p>As expected, whenever I was trying to use the copy paste command tool such as <code>xclip</code>, both vim and neovim produced the newlines on the X window system across different applications.</p>
<p>But when I set out to write an email on Gmail from Alphabet Inc., using a copy paste command tool such as <a href="https://github.com/astrand/xclip" target="_blank">xclip</a>, the process was to no avail: newlines were not being displayed on Gmail’s interface.</p>
<p>The closest match was a 2016 <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4501" target="_blank">Yanking to clipboard does not preserve newlines (when pasting to some applications</a> issue that was opened but was eventually closed because the user decided to have <code>xsel</code> take care of the problem for him/her.</p>
<p>But that post raised more questions than answers.</p>
<p>There was a reference on that thread about seeing a post on
unix.stackexchange.com: <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164074/pasting-in-thunderbird-turns-line-breaks-into-spaces" target="_blank">pasting-in-thunderbird-turns-line-breaks-into-spaces</a></p>
<p>After reading the link provided, I recall having come across the same post hours earlier when I was trying to find out more about the issue. A Google search with keywords including but not limited to <strong>xclip</strong> or <strong>newlines</strong>, or <strong>gmail</strong> or <strong>firefox</strong> would return as one of the first results, that specific post which appeared on the stackexchange network before any other post and more relevant results would showed up. Perhaps even those that were more important queries on the web were relegated, but I guess that’s an entirely different issue.</p>
<p>The answer that was accepted on the stackexchange network for that particular question did nothing to resolve the problem, and I guess it wasn’t until I came across the outstanding bugs on Firefox as I will show later, that the buried comment by a user name Volker Siegel was more relevant than I thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wow. I indeed was using html. Turning this off solved the problem. What could
be an explanation for that? – user2820379 Apr 28 ‘15 at 8:18</p>
<p>Explanation? “Thunderbird, a software that has evolved over more than a decade
to follow changes in protocols and UI expectations. Under these circumstances,
it is inevitable that the structure degrades - know as bit rot. In this
context, it is hard to introduce a new feature in conflict with the current
state, when solving the conflict is infeasible. A new UI feature like HTML
editing may need to be sneaked in between rotten skeletons of old protocol
layers. It will work nicely, but as a result, you will find the configuration
of the new feature down between these old rotten sediments.” – Volker Siegel

<p>I wanted to get at the reasoning behind this fiasco and whether to blame neovim or gmail for it.
On vim: pasting worked under the Gmail’s interface, whereas with neovim the process just failed: newlines turned into whitespace.</p>
<p>The bug is one of those outstanding and hence unresolved that for years has plagued the Firefox browser and its counterpart such as Firebird:</p>
<p><img src="/images/firefox_bug_newlines.png" alt="Paste in content editable div from xclip removes newlines"></p>
<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1049785" target="_blank">Paste in contentEditable div from xclip removes newlines</a></p>
<p>The above post made a reference to <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/gmail/aV8bdPFiR24/3Owwd9rSaD0J" target="_blank">Gmail ignoring newlines on Copy/Paste</a> and the unhelpful answer of a user did nothing to pinpoint at the problem:</p>
<p><img src="/images/gmail_ignoring_newlines_copypaste.png" alt="gmail ignoring newlines"></p>
<p>The ludicrous implementation of <code>\r</code> before <code>\n</code> is just nonsense.</p>
<p>And it also does not matter whether <code>printf</code> was used instead or a simple <code>echo</code>:</p>
<pre><code> $ echo -e 'una prueba\npara ver' | xclip -sel c 
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code> $ echo $'una prueba\npara ver' | xclip -sel c 
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>xsel</code> the flags are entirely different. But this clearly showed that Firefox is still trying to catch up with it. Gmail is not the problem. If it were I’d be more than happy to denote it. One could verify it by using a different email service such as Outlook from Microsoft for example.</p>
<p>A quick search related to Firefox turned out many more issues than what was originally intended, such as <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1174452" target="_blank">Copying text with the style “white-space: pre;” does not preserve white space (spaces, tabs, newlines)</a></p>
<p>On the above thread, an <a href="https://bug1174452.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8646518" target="_blank">attachment</a> provided can also be verified with <code>xclip</code>. It does not work under Firefox.</p>
<p>Another <a href="https://kb.iu.edu/d/bdkf">bug 116083</a> is still on the database for the Indiana University.</p>
