        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/errors-during-hugo-git/">Errors During Hugo Git</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Dec 13, 2017</span>
        <p>During the last setup of <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a>, I was faced again with the sometimes difficult handling of submodules. This was of course after the corresponding configuration for the <code>user.name</code> and <code>user.email</code> had already been set accordingly.</p>

<p>The next error which dealt with the git submodule was that it already existed in the index. Which made me look it up on Google.</p>

<p>Among the first results that came up after my query, was the following from the stackoverflow site at the StackExchange Network, entitled <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12898278/" target="_blank">Issue with adding common code as git submodule: “already exists in the index”</a></p>

<p>The answer that has been widely accepted included as a solution having to invoke the <code>git rm --cached projectfolder</code> on the tree of the folder.</p>

<p>After issuing it:</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm --cached .git/public 
 fatal: pathspec '.git/public' did not match any files
</code></pre>

<p>Which clearly led me nowhere, I noticed that further implementing correctly the command would require a few more steps.</p>

<p>The command <code>git push origin master</code> indicated that origin did not appear to be a git repository.</p>

<pre><code> $ git push origin master
 fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
 fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
</code></pre>

<p>It was only after I invoked the <code>git rm -rf public</code> which seemed to fix the problem:</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm -rf public/
 Migrating git directory of 'public' from
 '/public/.git' to
 '/.git/modules/public'
 rm 'public'
</code></pre>

<p>This seemed to at least tell me that the <code>public</code> folder had been removed. So apparently the <code>--cached</code> flag did nothing in this regard.</p>

<p>Next, by using the <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> key for autocompletion, right after the directories, I invoked <code>git rm -rf .git/modules</code>, which showed the number of possibilities as shown below:</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm -rf .git/modules/
 about                        index.html
 config.toml                  index.xml
 config.yaml                  js
 content                      page
 "content                     post
 css                          "post
 deploy.sh                    sitemap.xml
 .gitmodules                  static
 google4417fd3500b3c667.html  "static
 images                       tags
 "images                      themes
 img                          topics
</code></pre>

<p>Then again, I completed the <code>git rm -rf</code> with the corresponding <code>public</code> folder:</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm -rf .git/modules/public/
 fatal: pathspec '.git/modules/public/' did not match any files
</code></pre>

<p>Which unfortunately again, came back with the <strong>fatal: pathspec</strong> error from before.</p>

<p>What worked, was to have the option <code>--cached</code>, to be implemented right after <code>git rm</code> only recursively with the <strong>.gitmodules</strong>.</p>

<p>So that was</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm --cached .git
 .git/        .gitmodules  
</code></pre>

<p>Which finally after tab completion:</p>

<pre><code> $ git rm --cached .gitmodules 
 rm '.gitmodules'
</code></pre>

<p>So it seems the <code>git rm --cached</code> worked with the <strong>.gitmodules</strong>, but it did not succeed with the <strong>.git/modules/public</strong> directory.</p>

<p>It was only after I invoked the Unix command <code>rm -rf</code> under the <strong>.git</strong> directory, that the problem was finally resolved.</p>

<pre><code> $ rm -rf .git/modules/public/
</code></pre>

<p>After it, the submodule was added again with the</p>

<pre><code> git submodule add -b master &lt;name of static repository&gt; public
</code></pre>

<p>As shown below:</p>

<pre><code> $ git submodule add -b master https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;static repository&gt; public
 Cloning into '/public'...

 $ 
</code></pre>

<p>The step-by-step instructions by simply issuing <code>rm -rf public</code> as the <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/" target="_blank">tutorial to have Hugo running on Github</a> suggested, did not work in this case, for the simple reason that the <strong>git repository</strong> was cloned during the initial setup.</p>

<p>The <strong>.git/modules/public</strong> already existed as a result. So it had to be removed by issuing <strong>rm -rf .git/modules/public</strong> before setting up again the submodule remote repository.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/screen-locker-broken-manjaro-kde/">Screen Locker Broken Manjaro Kde</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Dec 9, 2017</span>
        <p>While updating a fresh installation of Manjaro KDE, the screen locked.
Apparently the default settings for the system, enabled this behavior without
further ado.</p>

<p>As a result of this problem, the surprising part came afterward when the updates that were being downloaded, suddenly crashed the system. This led to the nonetheless bothersome problem of <code>modules.devname not found</code> error followed by the no more troublesome error <code>you are now being dropped into an emergency shell</code> and <code>sh can't access tty; job control turned off</code>.</p>

<p>I didn’t have at the time a live media to access the system. Although I knew the that the sudden crashing during the download of updates , was one of the problems underlying the <code>modules.devname not found</code> error.</p>

<p>A quick google searched returned  <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/355689/manjaro-fails-to-boot-modules-devname-not-found-then-unknown-disk-uuid-error" target="_blank">Manjaro fails to boot, modules.devname not found</a> a result which provided an answer that pointed to access the system with Manjaro’s own <code>mhwd-chroot</code> command to access the emergency shell. See <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Restore_the_GRUB_Bootloader#Chroot_into_your_existing_Manjaro_Installation" target="_blank">Chroot into your existing Manjaro Installation</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/mhwd-chroot-steps.png" alt=""></p>

<p>And as the already mentioned answer on the unix.stackexchange.com site suggested, it was necessary to reload the image again.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/configuring-kakoune-kakrc/">Configuring Kakoune Kakrc</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Dec 6, 2017</span>
        <p>Configuring the <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune" target="_blank">kakoune text editor</a> initialization file has been nothing short of a chore, as it requires the path environment to be correctly set, before any changes on the <code>kakrc</code> take ahold of the settings.</p>

<p>As the tutorial suggests, see <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune#configuration-autoloading" target="_blank">Configuration and autoloading</a>, if it is launched with the <code>-n</code> switch, kakoune will source the <code>../share/kak/kakrc</code>, but on a unrelated issue but nonetheless relevant about the correct location for the initialization file, the developer clearly stated that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The kakrc file in share is Kakounes init script, it is not intended to be user edited. It is actually that script that will load your user configuration in ~/.config/kak/kakrc.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/images/dont-use-share-kakrc.png" alt=""></p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1102"
target="_blank">clang completion #1102</a></p>

<p>Thus, it is necessary to set the environment first on any Unix system. The command <code>setenv</code> is used for the <strong>csh</strong> shell, whereas in <strong>bash</strong>, this is accomplished through the <code>export</code> command.</p>

<p>To find out whether for example, <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> was set, is necessary to invoke on the terminal:</p>

<pre><code> printenv XDG_CONFIG_HOME
</code></pre>

<p>which if it does not return a value, the environment has not been set yet.</p>

<p>To set the environment across sessions, note it accordingly on your <code>bashrc</code> file with the <code>export</code> command:</p>

<pre><code> export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config
</code></pre>

<p>create a directory <strong>kak</strong> under that environment, and further create your init file <strong>kakrc</strong></p>

<p>Most of the available settings will be available without further modifications. That is, some of the commands that are loaded by not using a <code>kakrc</code> file, will not have to be further tweaked with.</p>

<pre><code> colorscheme &lt;tab completion&gt; &lt;name of theme&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>can be identified without a problem.</p>

<p>There are, however, a handful of those that would have to be further tweaked with, in order to load the <strong>kakrc</strong> init file correctly.</p>

<p>Take for example, <code>autowrap-enable</code>, which normally applies soft wrap manipulation to the lines.</p>

<p>According to the developer,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>autowrapping is provided by the autowrap.kak script (which should be loaded by default), enable it for a buffer with the autowrap-enable command, that you probably want to put in a hook (for example if you want to always enable autowrap, add hook global WinCreate .* %{ autowrap-enable } in your kakrc. the autowrap_column option controls the column on which to autowrap.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/419" target="_blank">Noob questions</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/autowrap-kakrc.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Further customizations to map certain keys are also necessary.</p>

<p>For example, to map the <code>\</code> backslash key to say the <code>;</code> semicolon., it’s imperative to precede the *<em>*</em> key with the <code>%</code> percent sign and further enclose the <code>\</code> backslash key within curly brackets <code>{}</code>, so the final code would be something like:</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert %{\} ';' 
</code></pre>

<p>of course, if the settings are desirable to be loaded globally, then</p>

<pre><code> map global insert %{\} ';'
</code></pre>

<p>needs to be specified accordingly on the initialization file.</p>

<p>See for example this issue: <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/419" target="_blank">can’t map to backslash</a>, which touched upon the problem, and further linked <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1049">https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1049</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1221">https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1221</a></p>

<p>It’s certainly two-fold that by specifying:</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert ';' \ 
</code></pre>

<p>the behavior to have the <code>\</code> inserted, is easily accomplished, as shown on the example above, but the same is not true, by having the same characters inversed within the strings, that would yield the correct results.</p>

<p>for example whereas</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert ';' \ 
</code></pre>

<p>is correct, a simple <code>map buffer insert '\' ;</code></p>

<p>throws an error with the message <code>parse error: unterminated string '...'</code></p>

<p>It’s therefore necessary to have:</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert %{;} \
</code></pre>

<p>the same is true if one were to <code>map buffer insert '\' %{;}</code></p>

<p>one of the methods that would work across buffers, is to have such characters enclosed within curly brackets and further preceded by the <code>%</code> sign</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert %{\} %{;} 
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code> map buffer insert %{;} %{\} 
</code></pre>

        <p>For some unknown reason, I was getting the message <code>network has been disconnected</code> even on connections that have been previously used.</p>

<p>Contrary to the post entitled <strong>NetworkManager doesn’t automatically ask for a password for new network</strong>, see <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=142066" target="_blank">see this post on bbs.archlinux.org</a> in my case the connection was used many times before.</p>

<p>The dependency problem that has plagued this bug seemed to make a comeback on a most of Manjaro desktop environments.</p>

<p>Installing, or better put, reinstalling it with</p>

<pre><code> yaourt -S gnome-keyring
</code></pre>

<p>seemed to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>The same problem hasn’t been experienced on Antergos distribution.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/mounting-a-windows-hard-drive-on-arch-linux/">Mounting a Windows Hard Drive on Arch Linux</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Nov 24, 2017</span>
        <p>After following some of the advice on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G">ntfs-3g arch linux</a> entry which described the procedure to mount a windows system:</p>

<p>A <code>lsblk -f</code> call on the filesystem returned:</p>

<pre><code> sdb                                                         
 ├─sdb1 vfat   SYSTEM   
 ├─sdb2 ntfs   Recovery 
 ├─sdb3                 
 ├─sdb4 ntfs   OS       
 └─sdb5 ntfs   Restore  
</code></pre>

<p>I was after <strong>sdb4</strong> in this case. So I invoked on the command line:</p>

<pre><code> $ ntfs-3g /dev/sdb4 /mnt/fat/
</code></pre>

<p>Which returned the message:</p>

<pre><code> Unprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE
 library. Either mount the volume as root, or rebuild NTFS-3G with integrated
 FUSE support and make it setuid root. Please see more information at
 http://tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#unprivileged
</code></pre>

<p>So with sudo privileges I invoked it again, but this time around the more precise error message that <em>Input/output error NTFS is inconsistent</em> was returned on the terminal. The entire message was as follows:</p>

<pre><code> ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error
 Failed to read of MFT, mft=391080 count=1 br=-1: Input/output error
 Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
 unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
 or fast restarting.)
 ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error
 Failed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error
 NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it's a
 SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows
 then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
 important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
 it
</code></pre>

<p>If I were to invoke it with <code>mount</code> instead of <code>ntfs-3g</code>, then it would have mounted it without a setback</p>

<pre><code> $ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb4 /mnt/fat
</code></pre>

<p>successfully mounted it and I was able to access the files on that hard drive.</p>

        <h1 class="post-title"><a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/git-committing-by-user-name-config/">Git Committing by User Name Config</a></h1>
        <span class="post-date">Nov 16, 2017</span>
        <p>I recently had to set up again the local branches through git.</p>

<p>An error that was not uncommon came up on the screen:</p>

<pre><code> *** Please tell me who you are.

 Run

   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"

 to set your account's default identity.
 Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
</code></pre>

<p>This time around it was done through configuring a <code>user.name</code> and a <code>user.email</code> on git itself.</p>

<p>It came to memory that the last time I was setting it up on a different system by pulling the sources from the remote branch, this configuration was never used.</p>

<p>An answer on stackoverflow reminded me that this was indeed the case the last time I had done it. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17713604" target="_blank"> instead of doing a git pull you can do a git fetch</a></p>

<pre><code> git fetch
 git reset --hard origin/master
</code></pre>

<p>Even if the error from <code>git</code> with the <strong>please tell me who you are</strong> comes up after an ssh key is granted, as it was posted on this other thread entitled <em>Git-please tell me who you are error when using ssh key</em>, the best alternative is to specify the <code>--global</code> option from <code>git</code> as it posted at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/42335651" target="_blank"> run git config –global user.email - git config –global user.name</a></p>

<p>Of course, if the option to have a <code>--global</code> configuration is not desirable, then the removal of this <code>.gitconfig</code> file may be accomplished through <strong>git</strong> again by issuing <code>git config --global --unset-all user.name</code> and <code>git config --global --unset-all user.email</code> from the terminal.</p>

<p>On the website that aims at answering questions about the ubuntu distributiion, there are more examples with this purpose. See for example <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/206449/" target="_blank"> git config global file - remove settings</a></p>

<p>The most important part about it lies on the command <strong>–unset-all</strong>, even though the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com//a/282550" target="_blank">  answer</a> which pointed at it was not the accepted solution in this case.</p>

<p>For more details about the config-file for <strong>git</strong> it is recommended to read the manual <strong>man git-config</strong> for more details.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Nov 8, 2017</span>
        <p><p>I recently tried a few utility programs through <strong>npm</strong> javascript manager. For further info see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)" target="_blank">Npm package manager</a> on Wikipedia.</p></p>

<p>But after trying them, I noticed that the output compilation was not what I had expected.</p>

<p>Usually, or so it seems, that by default the programs end up on <code>/usr/lib/node_modules</code>.</p>

<p>I kept one of the programs which I found it handy and very convenient. But I just wanted to remove the rest from the system.</p>

<p>But lo and behold. The removal outcome for the programs was not what I had expected either.</p>

<p><strong>npm</strong> threw errors even with sudo privileges.</p>

<pre><code> npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'package.json'
 npm WARN c No description
 npm WARN c No repository field.
 npm WARN c No README data
 npm WARN c No license field.
</code></pre>

<p>The problem was easily resolved by issuing the flag <code>-g</code> (get) for a successful uninstall. So that was <code>npm uninstall &lt;name&gt; -g</code>.</p>

<p>Later I checked on <code>/usr/lib/node_modules</code>, to make sure the program was no longer on the system.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Oct 19, 2017</span>
        <p>I currently have two (2) identical - or that’s what it seemed like - <strong>xfce</strong> environments on two (2) different hardware systems.</p>

<p>I always keep at hand a list of viewers and if there is any problem removing those to be found unnecessarily large or extremely light to the point of rendering them useless, I tend to check the Arch Wiki at <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications" target="_blank">List of Applications</a> for a refresher on what’s available at the moment.</p>

<p>I’ve always found useful, more or less two (2), or three (3) of them, among them, with a quick copy-paste from the Arch Wiki:</p>

<p>gv — Graphical user interface for the Ghostscript interpreter that allows to view and navigate through PostScript and PDF documents.</p>

<p>ePDFView — Free lightweight PDF document viewer using the Poppler and GTK+ libraries. Development stopped.</p>

<p>qpdfview — Tabbed document viewer. It uses Poppler for PDF support, libspectre for PS support, DjVuLibre for DjVu support, CUPS for printing support and the Qt toolkit for its interface.</p>

<p>The latter, strangely enough, was behaving differently on one of the <strong>manjaro xfce</strong> systems.</p>

<p>A quick google search turned pretty much nothing, related to this issue I was having: namely, the adjustment and consequent resizing for the Settings Window.</p>

<p><img src="/images/manjaro-xfce-qpdfview-settings-box-wrong.png" width="680px" height="450px;"></p>

<p>As you can see from the image above, I was unable to get to the bottom of the window whereto I could’ve specified <strong>to cancel</strong> or <strong>apply</strong> the changes to take effect via a GUI. What use is a GUI if one can’t access the main settings of the program?</p>

<p>This took me to the wrong path in trying to modify the settings upon which the <strong>Dialog box</strong> depended on.</p>

<p>The settings for <code>qpdfview.conf</code> were found right under the <code>.conf/qpdfview/</code> directory.</p>

<p>To no avail I tried to change the settings for the</p>

<pre><code> settingsDialogSize=@Size(488 803)
</code></pre>

<p>on the <strong>qpdfview.conf</strong> file, but every single time I did so, even after changing the above size to other feasible settings, the settings window loaded the default and preconfigured values for it, rendering any change I had made earlier such as modifying the values for that <strong>settingsDialogSize</strong> onto the configuration file,  obsolete.</p>

<p>Then I gave up tweaking around with the <code>qpdfview.conf</code> file. Even after removing this file, removing <strong>qpdfview</strong> along with all poppler libraries from the system, reinstalling the program again, logging out of the system, and restarting, and logging right back in, the problem still persisted.</p>

<p>The settings window remained, remained useless for the most part - and from a GUI’s perspective.</p>

<p>Of course I could have just pressed the <strong>carriage</strong> return key on the keyboard to apply the changes, or for that matter the <strong>escape</strong> key to discard any changes, but this was just besides the point, since it defeated the purpose of having GUI applications running. I needed it to be operational.</p>

<p>I tried another venue.</p>

<p>I noticed that every single time that the program <strong>qpdfview</strong> was invoked from the command line, several errors appeared, including the most significant of the lot:</p>

<pre><code> qt5ct: using qt5ct plugin
 qt5ct: D-Bus global menu: no
 Could not load plug-in in first attempt: ""
 "The shared library was not found."
</code></pre>

<p>the second of these messages was self-explanatory. The libraries upon which qpdfview relied upon, were not recognizing or finding the plugin.</p>

<p>A quick search on google later regarding <strong>qt5ct</strong> did not provide a satisfactory explanation behind the <strong>qpdfview</strong> problem.</p>

<p>I read some of the visual methods in adjusting the settings for <strong>qt</strong> on <a href="https://www.pcsuggest.com/qt5ct-change-qt5-application-style/" target="_blank">Change Qt5 application style with qt5ct</a></p>

<p>So I started <strong>qt5ct</strong>, and I noticed that the default settings for the window was to have <strong>gtk2</strong> as the style to be loaded.</p>

<p>Then right after I had changed it to one of the other values, I had high expectations that the changes would improve the dimensions of the dialog box settings for <strong>qpdfview</strong>. But I was wrong. It made everything worse off.</p>

<p>I finally had to tweak around with the problem directly through the <code>qt5ct.conf</code> file by changing the style field. Only then the problem with <strong>qpdfview</strong> was resolved.</p>

<pre><code> [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=gtk2
</code></pre>

<p>The style value was modified to <strong>Breeze</strong>, I saved the file and exited.</p>

<p>The <strong>qt5ct.conf</strong> file should have on the Appearance the following:</p>

<pre><code> [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=Breeze
</code></pre>

<p>Right after making the changes - not even a logout was required - <strong>qpdfview</strong> dialog box dimensions were working and definitely manageable. The only glitch - if it may be rightfully called as such - was an apparent back-to-back unwanted behavior in which the whole window for the settings, was not clearly visible, but one quick maximizing drag-around-movement maneuver, fixed the annoyance once and for all.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sep 29, 2017</span>
        <p><p>Bluetooth recognition - at least on Manjaro Xfce - has been erratic and inconsistent.</p></p>

<p>For no clear reason the LTS kernel and even a newer kernel have identified the hardware, while it has failed to do so in a great many occasions.</p>

<p>Many of the tweaks included reinstalling <code>bluez</code>, <code>bluez-firmware</code>, <code>bluez-libs</code>, <code>bluez-tools</code>, and <code>bluez-utils</code>.</p>

<p>Back to the drawing room and back again.</p>

<p>The bluetooth adapters were not being recognized however. And after logging out and back into the session, and even after <code>sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now</code>, nothing seemed to work.</p>

<p>The following day - to my surprise - I booted the system and it picked the bluetooth adapters without a problem.</p>

<p>It reminded me of a comment on the manjaro forum thread entitled <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/t/bluetooth-adapters-app-not-opening-bluetooth-manager-bluez-failed/4367/19" target="_blank">Bluetooth adapters app not opening Bluetooth Manager</a> in which one of the participants said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bluetooth support in Linux is always troublesome, even in Windows, smartphone, etc. So yeah, I think staying away from bluetooth related hardwares if you want a trouble free experience. Wireless hardwares nowadays are going towards a dedicated receiver way to handle wireless connection and that’s a better approach. Just my two cents <a href="https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/#blueref"><sup id="blueref">1</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to agree with him on that regard.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the desktop environment <strong>KDE</strong> hasn’t - I ran it for a short while and perhaps my feedback is worthless of consideration on that regard - given me the same problems than the current configuration under <strong>xfce</strong>.</p>

<p>But I never thought that the problems would persist even after the installation of a newer kernel. That is perhaps the main reason which has been drifting me away from <strong>xfce</strong> until further notice.</p>

<p>And while <strong>KDE</strong>-fanboys have come up with the slogan that <em>it grows on you</em>, <strong>xfce</strong> is perhaps a more GNU/Linux-centric configurable environment than the former. I still enjoy tweaking with its features even though its less polished than Plasma <strong>KDE</strong>. There is no question about this. <strong>KDE</strong> aims at the latest hardware, while <strong>xfce</strong> focuses on the rest. I’ve never tried to benchmark its memory and CPU consumption, but I’m almost certain it fairs much better than <strong>KDE</strong>.</p>

<p>Whether <strong>xfce</strong> will be a daily desktop environment driver running the main programs on which my workflow depends upon, it’s a question of time and how well it will handle them without a major setback.</p>

<p>Further oversights around Bluetooth vulnerabilities include technical papers such as <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.7253&rep=rep1&type=pdf" target="_blank">Security Risks in Bluetooth Devices</a>, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8872/521819c79505ac20e5da8dd14f8c41eb3f07.pdf" target="_blank">Bluetooth security threats and solutions</a></p>

<p>Even recent articles from <a
href="https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/2030213/blueborne-vulnerabilities-impact-over-5-billion-bluetooth-enabled-devices"
target="_blank">Slashdot - BlueBorne Vulnerabilities Impact Over 5 Billion
Bluetooth-Enabled Devices</a> have gone on at length about it. The following
paper - although unreliable since it looks more than a pamphlet from a company
that advertises its products under the pretension of providing unparalleled
protection - serves to confirm that regardless of its merit [this paper itsel]
is worth considering the possible risks could arise as a result from the
operations of bluetooth devices.</p>

        <p><p>I haven’t read the <code>man</code> pages enough to figure out some of the parameters that play an important behavior for the full functionality of the mighty <strong>urxvt</strong>, and it was not until I read a post - which was more of a comment on the thread entitled <a href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=221108" target="_blank">right click paste in urxvt terminal</a> on the archlinux.org forum - when I realized that by the combination of <strong>ctrl</strong> and right mouse click would copy and paste the selected text on the X window system.</p></p>
