      <description>One of the drawbacks during the installation of Antergos Linux was in identifying the keyboard layout option that was previously selected during the media installation.
As a result only the default variant was being used after installing the system.
I was able to identify the problem by going to the X window system xorg configuration file /etc/X11/xorg.d/00-keyboard.conf and noticing that the XkbLayout variant was not being properly identified as originally intended.</description>

      <title>Antergos Grub Selection</title>

      <description>During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.
Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.
this is even after running the usual mkinitcpio -p &amp;lt;linux kernel&amp;gt; that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.
It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.</description>
