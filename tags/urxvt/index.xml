      <description>I haven’t read the man pages enough to figure out some of the parameters that play an important behavior for the full functionality of the mighty urxvt, and it was not until I read a post - which was more of a comment on the thread entitled right click paste in urxvt terminal on the archlinux.org forum - when I realized that by the combination of ctrl and right mouse click would copy and paste the selected text on the X window system.</description>

      <description>I’ve never bothered with urxvt in the past. Perhaps was the way that dealt with the default glyph, which discouraged me from using it.
Later I found that the above was easily answered here at how can I get better looking fonts in my terminal (urxvt)
Nonetheless, the simple fact that I had to modify it directly on .Xresources, stopped me from doing all the necessary modifications to accomplish it.</description>
