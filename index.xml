        <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the recommendations the block of code should be in one
line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=1
snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1
snd_bcm2835.enable_compat_alsa=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rpi4 has had trouble for a while now, especially running
under Arch Linux with the sound output from the headphones
jack source. I&amp;rsquo;ve usually read a great many threads
dealing with this issue before. Unfortunately, many of the
solutions/recommendations/suggestions haven&amp;rsquo;t resolved the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other distros have dealt successfully with this issue before. But
whether it has been casued for some given reason or another,
in the case of ArchlinuxArm this has been an outstanding issue
in a great many number of occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration files and particular model and versions for the
rpi4 as it has been outlined on many of the threads, are not quite
that different from mine, and yet the issue was not resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read about this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15090&amp;amp;start=0&#34;&gt;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15090&amp;amp;start=0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therein, another specific thread dealing with this issue was opened
which followed over here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15128&amp;amp;p=65808#p65816&#34;&gt;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15128&amp;amp;p=65808#p65816&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15070&#34;&gt;sound on rpi model
4b&lt;/a&gt; was
for example, specifically opened to collect more information about
some of the back then outstanding issues with the rpi4 model b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above also links to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=15128&amp;amp;p=65808#p65816&#34;&gt;Re: fresh rpi4b install with linux-raspberrypi&lt;/a&gt;
which as one might guessed by going over it, it deals with
installing another kernel tailored to this particular sound problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the posted code may not apply to the particular model, but
as the author clearly specified, many of these settings might differ
considerably from one&amp;rsquo;s setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arm_64bit=1
enable_gic=1
dtparam=i2c_arm=on
dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231
dtparam=audio=on
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt
disable_overscan=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, another thread entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;amp;t=15056&amp;amp;p=65576&amp;amp;hilit=alsa#p65576&#34;&gt;alsa - device not
found&lt;/a&gt;
was posted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In it, there were some specific packages that must be installed such
as (at the time of writing):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;alsa-firmware 1.2.4-2
alsa-lib 1.2.4-3
alsa-plugins 1:1.2.2-2
alsa-topology-conf 1.2.4-2
alsa-ucm-conf 1.2.4-2
alsa-utils 1.2.4-2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these, the author also linked
another thread &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&amp;amp;t=14734&amp;amp;start=50#p65549&#34;&gt;Re:No usb detected on rpi4 with
aarch64&lt;/a&gt;
which it also suggested to have the package &lt;strong&gt;mpg123&lt;/strong&gt; installed
as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# dtoverlay=vc4-kms-v3d
dtparam=audio=on
hdmi_force_hotplug=1
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=2000
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;One must always remember that this may have been the settings for that
particular setup. &lt;code&gt;dtoverlay=&lt;/code&gt; for example was commented out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by now one must realize, that the most widely accepted
configuration has been  so far &lt;code&gt;dtparam=audio=on&lt;/code&gt;. It has been
brought up for many use cases before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course. All of the above is assuming that another kernel,
that of &lt;strong&gt;linux-raspberrypi4&lt;/strong&gt; would be installed to take care
of this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Reddit for example, this has been also the accepted suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinuxarm/comments/obxh8i/need_help_with_sound_on_raspberry_pi_4/&#34;
target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Need help with sound on rpi4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as one of the users said: &lt;em&gt;I use the linux-raspberrypi4
kernel. Installed pulseaudio, ran it and everything worked
perfectly. Don&amp;rsquo;t remember doing anything else other than selecting
the correct output device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, about a year ago or more when I installed arch linux
arm on this particular model, I tried, albeit unsuccessfully to
resolve this issue with this aforementioned kernel
&lt;strong&gt;linux-raspberrypi4&lt;/strong&gt;. It didn&amp;rsquo;t work. No sound was ever coming out
of the headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another user who opened a similar topic outlining the
problematic sound with rpi4 under Arch &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;amp;t=14641&#34;&gt;rpi4b: no audio device
found&lt;/a&gt;
in his case, the culprit seemed to stem from a permission issue
with the file in question. Not in mine. I had also checked file
permissions, but it was not causing the misdetection identifying
the port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other posts such as this one for example
at reddit with the title &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinuxarm/comments/ou1ej4/rpi4_running_armv7_archlinux_audio_does_not_work/&#34;&gt;Rpi4 running armv7
archlinux , audio does not work through the onboard 3.5mm audio
jack&lt;/a&gt;
barely provided any insight at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to archlinuxarm.org there were other threads related with the
underlying issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one simply titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;amp;t=12408&#34;&gt;Re: No
sound&lt;/a&gt;
it specified to have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dtparam=audio=on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hdmi_drive=2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;one of the users specified that: &lt;em&gt;Without hdmi_drive=2 you should
get sound from the jack on the rpi.&lt;/em&gt; , or by commenting it out.
This was also specified before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course. This is not the first time the fellow users over at
archlinuxarm.org have had to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this thread with the title
&lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;amp;t=15470&#34;&gt;Analog Audio not working in rpi4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;I am not getting audio from 3.5 mm audio jack in my raspberry
pi 4. I have done a clean install of arch. I have installed
pulseaudio, alsa-utils still iam not getting the audio.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had also done the same, but to no avail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the recommendaton for the op was, as in
this reply &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&amp;amp;t=15470#p67053&#34;&gt;Re: analog audio not working in
rpi4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dtoverlay=upstream-pi4
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This didn&amp;rsquo;t work either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were also a couple of suggestions or likely solutions to
this issue with the rpi4, archlinuxarm and sound  that ranged from
the aforementioned websites dedicated to the arch linux arm wiki,
as well as in the stackexchange network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one from archlinuxarm.org was titled: &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;amp;t=15352&#34;&gt;Rpi4 No
Sound&lt;/a&gt;
in which an error was preventing the user from running a script such
as &lt;code&gt;amixer -q cset numid=3 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one for example was also dealing the same issue of sound on
te rpi4 and arch linux arm, and
&lt;code&gt;amixer cset numid&lt;/code&gt; command  to execute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question on the stackexchange network
with the rpi, was &lt;a href=&#34;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/no-audio-output-on-3-5mm-jack&#34;&gt;No Audio Output on 3.5mm
Jack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;thes user wrote that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  I have tried turning up the sound in alsamixer as well as
  running modprobe snd_bcm2835. I have also tried to play
  the files with aplay rather than ncmpcpp with no luck.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the respondents (who also got the accepted answer for this
sort of problem) said to have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;amixer cset numid=3 1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was quoted as saying on the answer that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;   The last number is the audio output with 1 being the 3.5
   jack, 2 being HDMI and 0 being auto.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one must remember that the latter was, by the looks of it, posted as
an acceptable answer to this particular problem before the
question/answer came up from archlinuxarm.org.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;modprobe snd_bcm2835
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;as well as &lt;code&gt;aplay -L&lt;/code&gt; were implemented accordingly by this user in
an effort to figure out what the problem might be with the sound and
the rpi4 model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/no-audio-output-on-3-5mm-jack&#34;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/13499/no-audio-output-on-3-5mm-jack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more inquiries and suggestions may be further found with
Google about this troublesome behavior. It certainly is one of
the pressing outstanding issues with this awesome distribution
and the model of the rpi4 in question&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux Arm wiki&lt;/strong&gt;, (which I&amp;rsquo;ll copy and paste) for
example, states, in regards to the audio:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;raspberry-pi&#34;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;audio&#34;&gt;Audio&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;alsa-utils should supply the needed programs to use onboard sound. Default volume can be adjusted using alsamixer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A key change with Linux kernel version 4.4.x for ARM related to ALSA and to the needed sound module: in order to use tools such as alsamixer with the current kernel, users must modify /boot/config.txt to contain the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;dtparam=audio=on
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;caveats-for-audio&#34;&gt;Caveats for Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To force audio over HDMI, add this to /boot/config.txt:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hdmi_drive=2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you experience distortion using the 3.5mm analogue output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;audio_pwm_mode=2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/archlinuxarmrpi4wiki.png&#34; alt=&#34;wiki&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinuxarm.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi&#34;&gt;https://archlinuxarm.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What worked in my case were a few lines on the configuration file
that I personally never thought that were going to resolve the sound
issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=1
snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1
snd_bcm2835.enable_compat_alsa=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/answer-sound-raspberry-pi-forum.png&#34; alt=&#34;answer-snd-2835&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Re: Pi4 - No hdmi audio
Tue Jan 21, 2020 9:23 am&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; HDMI audio should work in both ports, but there may be some config
 you can do to make it better.
 
 Add this to the end of the line in cmdline.txt file in /boot
 (all must be on the same line)
 
 snd_bcm2835.enable_headphones=1 snd_bcm2835.enable_hdmi=1
 snd_bcm2835.enable_compat_alsa=0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Slackware Startx Blank Screen Without Imobiledeviceglue</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/slackware-startx-blank-screen-without-imobiledeviceglue/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 03:07:36 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/slackware-startx-blank-screen-without-imobiledeviceglue/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Blank screen kde plasma wayland on Slackware was the issue this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had tried to run level 3 on slackware current kde plasma by invoking, as I had done before, &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt; on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with the most current slackware as of this writing, and after successfully upgrading the system, I was still unable to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some post dating back to 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/slackware-current-kde5-startx-failed-4175662813/&#34;&gt;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/slackware-current-kde5-startx-failed-4175662813/&lt;/a&gt;  pointed to do an upgrade. Of which I had done. So this suggestion led nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After checking many of the issues as described on linuxquestions which resembled some of the behavior such as logging in through level 4 on sddm as this one pointed out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/blank-screen-on-startx-for-kde-at-kernel-5-10-4-a-4175687833/page2.html&#34;&gt;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/blank-screen-on-startx-for-kde-at-kernel-5-10-4-a-4175687833/page2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but noticed that not only I was unable to log in through sddm but also a message that read the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;The current theme can not be loaded due to the errors below, please select another theme:

file:///usr/share/sddm/themes/Breeze/Main.qml:14:1:plugin cannot be loaded for module &amp;#34;org.kde.plasma.core&amp;#34; cannot load library /usr/lib64/qt5/qml/org/kde/plasma/core&amp;#34; libcorebindingsplugin.so (libimobiledevice-glue-1.0.so.0 cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;This of course served no discernible help at all, as Google quickly confirmed, a search for &lt;code&gt;bindingsplugin.so&lt;/code&gt; returned unrelated results while recently, as of today, a search on Google for &amp;lt;libcorebindingsplugin.so slackware&amp;gt; pointed out that the solution for the problem would be to &lt;code&gt;slackpkg install-new&lt;/code&gt;. But for as long as I have updated the system on Slackware, with the kernel and packages, I have always foregone from invoking, even though is technically correct after a system upgrade, such command as &lt;code&gt;slackpkg install-new&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time I had read that suggestion, which I noticed just now, as of this writing that it had been posted only a few days ago, I had already found, perhaps not as elegant, a solution on the system to invoke &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt; successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow while invoking &lt;strong&gt;kwin_wayland&lt;/strong&gt; though &lt;code&gt;startkwayland&lt;/code&gt; I noticed, unlike before, that was returning the error: &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/kwin_wayland: error while loading shared libraries: libimobiledevice-glue-1.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&lt;/code&gt; which quickly identified the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one given reason or another (which I don&amp;rsquo;t know), it seemed that the file for this shared library  was not installed afterwards. Perhaps the file was not using the same repo as the repo that was being used during  the system upgrade. And that is most likely the cause. &lt;code&gt;imobiledevice-glue&lt;/code&gt; was using another repo, not the one used during the system upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing it with &lt;code&gt;slackpkg install imobiledevice-glue&lt;/code&gt; kde plasma was successfully loaded with &lt;code&gt;startx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Guake Module Not Found Pbr — no module named pbr</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/guake-module-not-found-pbr/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 04:08:20 EDT</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/guake-module-not-found-pbr/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As I decided to run slackware current rather than 14.2, as I had done before, there were perhaps a couple of packages that although were not officially supported, had to be manually configured and compiled again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among these packages was the drop-down terminal &lt;strong&gt;guake&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike &lt;strong&gt;yakuake&lt;/strong&gt;, which is normally configured without a major setback, running 14.2 required at one point to have vte3 installed, as well as pbr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter one however, proved to be a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error &lt;code&gt;error: invalid command &#39;bdist_wininst&#39;&lt;/code&gt; kept coming up without further info. A quick googling around this problem led me to actually nowhere, since one of the comments mentioned about removing support for &lt;strong&gt;wininst&lt;/strong&gt; but this &lt;a href=&#34;comment&#34;&gt;https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/857#issuecomment-273274212&lt;/a&gt; dated as far back as 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another error that showed up — no matter what I did to circumvent it during the installation of guake — was the most infamous of all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;guake &lt;code&gt;ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;pbr&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it made no difference whatsoever whether I had tried to install it to another path as the command &lt;code&gt;pip install --user guake&lt;/code&gt; as the guake project suggested, or even a &lt;code&gt;pip3 install guake&lt;/code&gt; as it had been previously suggested over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1328#&#34;&gt;https://github.com/Guake/guake/issues/1328#&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resorting to an old fashioned method such as &lt;code&gt;python -m pip install guake&lt;/code&gt; as it was outlined on the documentation &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html&#34;&gt;https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html&lt;/a&gt; had also proved as useless as anything before it. So there was no easily discernible workaround, or so it seemed, to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally with &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; the packages are installed under &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/bin&lt;/code&gt; and even exporting the path made no difference either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What gives at this point? The only difference with the current slack were a number of a few packages such as python3 and pygobject among many, that had been upgraded accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I even went as far as installing &lt;code&gt;python3-setuptools&lt;/code&gt; on the system, but this, too, resolved nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when I tried to find all traces of guake on the system, it did showed up under both python-2 and python-3 dirs respectively. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know whether this may have been one of the underlying causes for the &lt;code&gt;no module found pbr&lt;/code&gt; message though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also downloded guake sources directly from github, and compiled it from thnere, to no further avail either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had decided to almost give up on the issue, but as a last resort there was the possibility — even though the chances were slim or so it seemed to successfully install guake and/or pbr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went ahead and read on &lt;a href=&#34;https://sbopkg.org/&#34;&gt;https://sbopkg.org/&lt;/a&gt; after going around on an older thread from 2011 &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/how-can-i-search-for-unofficial-packages-in-slackware-%2Apackages-like-guake-terminal%2A-888155/&#34;&gt;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/how-can-i-search-for-unofficial-packages-in-slackware-%2Apackages-like-guake-terminal%2A-888155/&lt;/a&gt; that mentioned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the initial setup and further reading through &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.slackware.com/howtos:slackware_admin:building_packages_with_sbopkg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; documentation for sbopkg&lt;/a&gt;,  the first search directly from the terminal returned a &lt;code&gt;no match found&lt;/code&gt; which took me back to Google again to see what this was about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein one of the most relevant links pointed out to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/sbopkg-and-installed-sbo-git-packages-not-appears-4175632613/&#34;&gt;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/slackware-14/sbopkg-and-installed-sbo-git-packages-not-appears-4175632613/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changed to the suggested directory and everything seemed to check accordingly. I had specified the repo directly from sbopkg and synced it afterwards. The configuration file rightly noted the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first install of guake, however, returned the same error as before. I decided to go ahead and remove &lt;code&gt;removepkg&lt;/code&gt;anything under /tmp/ with sudo privileges for both &lt;code&gt;pbr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guake&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t until I specified the current Sbo-git and searched the packages interface for both &lt;strong&gt;pbr&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;guake&lt;/strong&gt; later on, that the guake compilation went through without further error messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guake returned no errors afterwards. As a matter of fact, I&amp;rsquo;m writing all of this, hoverever relevant it may be, (and acknowledging failure for not providing a back log that would detail all error messages with both &lt;strong&gt;pbr&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;guake&lt;/strong&gt; during these unfinished compilations) by using this fast drop-down terminal. Yakuake also provides a similar interface, and many users from the slackware community may point out, and rightly so, that it works even better than guake, minus the aggravation with unofficial packages such as guake under slackware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the bottom line here is: I can&amp;rsquo;t recommend &lt;strong&gt;Sbopkg&lt;/strong&gt; highly enough. Whatever the issue there was, with both &lt;code&gt;pbr&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;guake&lt;/code&gt;, seemed to have been finally resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I only wished I had tried &lt;strong&gt;sbopkg&lt;/strong&gt; sooner.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cannot Convert String Helvetica Medium to Type Fontstruct</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/cannot-convert-string-helvetica-medium-to-type-fontstruct/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 20 Dec 2020 08:30:13 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/cannot-convert-string-helvetica-medium-to-type-fontstruct/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This could very well qualify among one of the most pesky annoyingly error messages that one could ever come across, under the X window system. Of course there are many other errors that are certainly more problematic, but the aformentioned warning is one that requires, as I&amp;rsquo;m doing now, to write a few words about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, by simply installing any of the &lt;code&gt;xorg-fonts-75dpi&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;xorg-fonts-100dpi&lt;/code&gt; packages, would have gotten this issue resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could further consult similar posts under the Arch forum that inquired about this problem. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=21713&#34; target=_blank&gt;missing helvetica font&lt;/a&gt; or also &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=189463&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Fonts: cannot convert string… to type Fontstruct&lt;/a&gt;, or even albeit unrelated — since this issue at this other site, was concerned under another program perhaps — on the linuxquestions forum entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/error-message-regarding-fonts-in-grace-943919/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Error message regarding fonts in grace&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time around, there must have been some sort of update that most likely has been breaking up the way that a non error, and consequentially working without a warning of any kind would come up under the X system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invoking &lt;code&gt;xlsfonts | grep helvetica&lt;/code&gt; was not returning anything for that matter, and restarting the system a great number of times failed for not showing the error/warning and &amp;lsquo;fixing&amp;rsquo; the underlying issue either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to circumvent it this time around, was by installing the &lt;code&gt;adobe-base-14-fonts&lt;/code&gt; from the AUR repositories. Something that, as I already said, never had to be include it, to have the error/warning not coming up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further resources about this package may be found at &lt;a href=&#34;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/adobe-base-14-fonts/&#34;&gt;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/adobe-base-14-fonts/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Error Bash Completion No Such File or Directory</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-bash-completion-no-such-file/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 09 Jun 2020 02:59:45 EDT</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-bash-completion-no-such-file/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know where to look —- I certainly can browse the &lt;a href=&#34;https://packages.debian.org/buster/bash-completion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; from Debian reposotiry — or where bash completion is usually installed on Debian-based distributions. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I have used these kind of systems. But after all, this is irrelevant. Even as popular as this distro may be,  not everyone uses it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick glance at the files that comprise this program, one could see that aside from the &lt;code&gt;usr&lt;/code&gt; folder, bash completion is also installed under &lt;code&gt;etc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bin&lt;/code&gt; accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bash completion allows to fill in the rest of the commands or variables that follow for given executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash#Tab_completion&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bash autocompletion&lt;/a&gt; for more details about its chock features&amp;rsquo; versatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Arch, the installation does not create — unlike on Debian — the folder &lt;code&gt;bash_completion&lt;/code&gt; under &lt;code&gt;etc&lt;/code&gt;. And I don&amp;rsquo;t think this may have been an oversight from the Arch team, but presumably and perhaps due to safety reasons,  this was something that was never considered in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other programs have had no issue by correctly including on the script the means to have it install appropriately. But it&amp;rsquo;s my opinion — and anyone is more than welcome to disagree with me here — that many a great number of programs have not chosen to do so or failed altogether in this regard. Hugo for example is one of them. See for example the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; destination directory&lt;/a&gt; when this feature was added. See the commit &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/pull/1088/commits/ccdf544f73dda2ff2dd8bf0407a77e21084c59e8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To resolve this issue, the most viable solution is to manually add the folder, from whence this error stems, or else the message&lt;code&gt;Error: bash_completion.d: hugo.sh no such file or directory&lt;/code&gt; will disallow the &lt;code&gt;autocomplete&lt;/code&gt; which was added to the binaries of this  program, to come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting the time and date by invoking &lt;code&gt;hwclock --systohc&lt;/code&gt; or by &lt;code&gt;hwclock --hctosys&lt;/code&gt; should always be followed by &lt;code&gt;localtime&lt;/code&gt; rather than say by &lt;code&gt;--utc&lt;/code&gt; wich is the Universal Corrdinated Time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if multiple systems are to be used, it may be useful to better have the hardware clock synchronized in UTC in case that time zone and DST Daylight Savings Time come into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omitting appending something as simple as &lt;code&gt;--localtime&lt;/code&gt; would certainly display the UTC on multiple systems under any hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case of any trouble setting it up afterwards may resolve the issue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;timedatectl set-timezone 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, one may invoke:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hwclock --set --date &amp;#39;mm/dd/yyyy 00:00:00&amp;#39;
hwclock --hctosys --localtime
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

        <title>Pamac Gui Wps Office Curl 22 The Requested URL Returned Error 416</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pamac-gui-wps-office-curl-22/</link>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pamac-gui-wps-office-curl-22/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On a recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wps.com/linux&#34;&gt;WPS&lt;/a&gt; upgrade through pamac gui, there was a somewhat inconvenient &lt;code&gt;curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 416 &lt;/code&gt;  error which I wasn&amp;rsquo;t ready for,  at the time it happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the updates had gone through any major problem, but this seemed to go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no issues elsewhere and with another system in which the updates went through without any setback there seemed to be no issues either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after updating the &lt;strong&gt;mirrorlist&lt;/strong&gt;, I was still facing the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick google search led me to, among the most relevant results, a post that was entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.manjaro.org/t/wps-office-failure-while-downloading/112800/3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; wps-office: failure while downloading &lt;/a&gt;  that was brought up by the manjaro distro users to the devs - the latter group  is after all,  the one behind the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.manjaro.org/applications/pamac&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; development of the pamac graphical interface program &lt;/a&gt; - in which some folks pointed out the possibility of a network problem. Unlike the op issue, mine had primarily to do with an upgrade of the wps suite, and not an installation or reinstall. And also, just  as another user stated on the same forum, I had made sure that the network paralleled culprit wasn&amp;rsquo;t preventing the upgrade of wps from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since wps office is provided by AUR which is the largest unofficial repository package t Arch Linux, the best course of action was to reset the upgrade through the pamac program itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Wps Office Spanish Dictionary</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/wps-office-spanish-dictionary/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Dec 2019 22:51:32 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/wps-office-spanish-dictionary/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve installed many text formatting processors over the years, or as they are simply abbreviated with the acronyms WYSIWYG&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many users prefer the advantages provided by a cloud stored-word processing program such as the one provided by Google, I tend to steer away from it mainly because of response time within the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;rsquo;m not oblivious either to the fact that the versioning control system as it was implemented by Google, is surely a breakthrough innovation among these programs, which needless to say, many of these other programs - including the one provided by Microsoft - at least the one provided for local installation  - has failed to develop such a feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this simple implementation alone I consider it an advantage over any desktop solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when it comes to locally installed programs,  I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to consider the pros and cons and one way or another I&amp;rsquo;ve always tried to install - as I said earlier - the one with the overall best response time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this reason alone - notwithstanding the license under which the program is developed and which its devs and maintainers have put it in use, and which I always encourage to go over some its terms to clarify any further ambiguity,  and also without disregarding either the proprietary background of the company Kingsoft Office, which is the one that came up with the product,  &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wps.com/linux&#34;&gt;wps office for linux&lt;/a&gt; provides almost exactly,  what a vendor such as the program that Microsoft has been able to successfully come up with over the years: a whole suite of spreadsheet, word processor, and presentation programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it&amp;rsquo;s usually the case whenever I&amp;rsquo;m using this program, I&amp;rsquo;ve always toggled back and forth between languages and the dictionaries in use, and even though is no less true that one could easily go directly to whatever pre-compiled version the distribution has put together for the user, to have it installed on the machine nonetheless &amp;ndash; along with the language pack for it &amp;ndash; , is not clearly documented. And to make this issue less straightforward than what it ought to be, the devs have modified or for a better usage of the word - have diverged over the years  as to where the destination directories for these dictionaries are to be placed under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, at one given point in time, the company provided the download link for the language of choice by making it  available by simply clicking  directly on their website, but for one reason or another I&amp;rsquo;ve recently found that the link was no longer accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve said before, the distro would most likely have the language pack of choice available for the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I personally didn&amp;rsquo;t want to go this route this time around neither, and wanted instead,  to install the language pack so the program would identify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The destination for the dictionaries is not under &lt;code&gt;.local&lt;/code&gt; but rather over at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/office6/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;therein another subdirectory under &lt;code&gt;dicts&lt;/code&gt; aptly entitled &lt;code&gt;spellcheck/&lt;/code&gt; which further shows the default language directory - which is normally &lt;strong&gt;en_US&lt;/strong&gt; in this case, is the folder from which the program would first look up any relevant file to be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The language pack dictionary for wps-office namely provides three (3) files with the suffixes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*.dic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*.aff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;*.conf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these files must be copied over to a newly created directory under the same subdirectory &lt;code&gt;dicts/spellcheck&lt;/code&gt; as it was outlined earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the directory for which these other language files are to be put under, is   either copied in its entirety - the whole directory with all the aforementioned files - or that the directory in question is indeed created from scratch&amp;hellip; There&amp;rsquo;s no other way around this issue, as long as wps-office identifies and recognizes multiple dictionaries to be loaded up as soon as the program starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filenames for all the dictionaries - whether these are from the packaged &lt;strong&gt;en_US&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;en_GB&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;es_ES&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;es_MX&lt;/strong&gt; etc all have identical names, thus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main.dic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;main.aff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dict.conf&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;comprise the &lt;del&gt;file&lt;/del&gt; directory list&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I - without trying to sound pedantic - brought up the reason as by which one must be careful,  not to simply copy over just the additional files for the other language to be used, as this could potentially &lt;strong&gt;overwrite&lt;/strong&gt; the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other option would be by trying to &lt;strong&gt;rename&lt;/strong&gt; the files &amp;ndash; from say a hunspell installation &amp;ndash; to &lt;code&gt;main.aff&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;main.dic&lt;/code&gt;, and modifiy the contents of the file &lt;code&gt;dict.conf&lt;/code&gt; respectively to the preferred  language in question.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sed and Awk to Print Ranges</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/sed-and-awk-to-print-ranges/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 27 Dec 2019 00:47:09 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/sed-and-awk-to-print-ranges/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; are very powerful tools that would yield results unlike anything else in *Nix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although one could certainly create constructs within say a bash script that would give it further fuel, it comes handy to have it as it&amp;rsquo;s always the case: available,  for even other menial tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Printing a given range of lines would undoubtedly come practical during those times when simply displaying them directly by invoking the manual is proven not to be the most straightforward method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for this purpose both &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; serve me well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to invoke with &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; a certain range of lines to print say from the XParseGeometry manual or from any other file on the system, filtering it out gives - as the proverbial saying goes - power for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, it helps to have the entire &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; pages on the terminal, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t filter out the results as I have wanted it to. One may try by using &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t interested this time around to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;man XParseGeometry | awk &amp;#39;NR==20,NR==40&amp;#39; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;would hence return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fheight
       fwidth    Specify the font height and width in  pixels  (increment
                 size).

       parsestring
                 Specifies the string you want to parse.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height determined.

       xadder
       yadder    Specify  additional  interior padding needed in the win‐
                 dow.

       x_return
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;returned what I was after..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; things are perhps easier, and a great many users recommend to go this route for simple tasks such as the one I usually encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;man XParseGeometry | sed -n &amp;#39;20,40&amp;#39;p
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;would rightly return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
       display   Specifies the connection to the X server.

       fheight
       fwidth    Specify the font height and width in  pixels  (increment
                 size).

       parsestring
                 Specifies the string you want to parse.

       screen    Specifies the screen.

       width_return
       height_return
                 Return the width and height determined.

       xadder
       yadder    Specify  additional  interior padding needed in the win‐
                 dow.

       x_return
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;which gives me exactly what I was after&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the magic of Unix doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop there. One could further delve into even more  commands to give both &lt;code&gt;sed&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; an unimaginable power for pattern searching without having to entirely &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; it&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having other simple tasks such as looking up particular pattern on a given file, is much more easier which could print out the results satisfactorily&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for a given file &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sed -n &amp;#39;2,4&amp;#39;p &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;and through &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; a simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;awk &amp;#39;NR==&amp;lt;range&amp;gt;,NR==&amp;lt;range&amp;gt;&amp;#39; &amp;lt;filename&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;should suffice.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Fc-List Get Fonts</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/fc-list-get-fonts/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 23 Dec 2019 22:53:32 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/fc-list-get-fonts/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always nice to have a &amp;lsquo;cheat sheet&amp;rsquo; summary of all sorts Unix to remember certain programs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually have &lt;code&gt;Lua&lt;/code&gt; looking this up for me through &lt;code&gt;otf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ttf&lt;/code&gt; fonts, but it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I went this route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fontconfig &lt;/code&gt;takes care of all font-related&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;fontconfig&lt;/a&gt; takes care &amp;ndash; as the freedesktop.org website states to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discover new fonts when installed automatically, removing a common source of configuration problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;perform font name substitution, so that appropriate alternative fonts can be selected if fonts are missing.
identify the set of fonts required to completely cover a set of languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;have GUI configuration tools built as it uses an XML-based configuration file (though with autodiscovery, we believe this need is minimized).
efficiently and quickly find the fonts you need among the set of fonts you have installed, even if you have installed thousands of fonts, while minimzing memory usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;be used in concert with the X Render Extension and FreeType to implement high quality, anti-aliased and subpixel rendered text on a display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does not provide any searching mechanism to look up a particular font on the system. Or at the very least not one that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of anyway..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, &lt;code&gt;fc-list&lt;/code&gt; does list the fonts available on the system&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only caveat is that if I were to try to get the family name of the glyph in question, &lt;code&gt;fc-list&lt;/code&gt; does provide it, but I would need to further &lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; it in order to not get a bunch of results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fc-list&lt;/code&gt; is simply put:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FC-LIST(1)                                                     FC-LIST(1)

NAME
       fc-list - list available fonts

SYNOPSIS
       fc-list  [  -vVh ] [ --verbose ] [ -f format | --format format ] [
       -q | --quiet ] [ --version ] [ --help ]
           [ pattern  [ element ... ]  ]

DESCRIPTION
       fc-list lists fonts and styles available on the system for  appli‐
       cations  using  fontconfig.   If  any elements are specified, only
       those are printed.  Otherwise family and style are printed, unless
       verbose output is requested.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;a printing mechanism to list the fonts on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;grep&lt;/code&gt; [ing] the font itself through the program, filters out the family name of the font as well - and whether these are otf or ttf.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pacman Gtk Doc File Exists in Filesystem</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pacman-gtk-doc-file-exists-in-filesystem/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 23 Nov 2019 01:10:01 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pacman-gtk-doc-file-exists-in-filesystem/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It was odd that seemingly identical pamac installations loaded onto very similarly configured machines,  were somehow behaving differently on a great many occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both pamac versions had been downloaded and configured and compiled apparently via the same procedure. Both systems also had been configured not much that different from one another. But on one of the systems, pamac would eventually return an error during the same updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamac would simply hang, egregiously stuck at either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  checking inter-dependencies
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or during&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  checking inter-conflicts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, I could have just  dismissed all these errors and be happily content to just get rid of this nonsense by removing pamac altogether and start afresh from the official package manager, but I would have never been happy by either settling these problems through such trivialities, as long as another system, on which the very same package was installed, was not showing the same behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had it given me a problematic workaround at the very least - on the other system that is,  which was working flawlessly nonetheless, -there would have been no doubt that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have even considered this extraneous interface to start off with, and would have gone  instead through pacman directly. Or I could have taken further steps and try to at least, file a bug report as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#%22Failed_to_commit_transaction_(conflicting_files)%22_error&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Wiki suggests&lt;/a&gt;. But I always liked the design idea behind this graphical interfaced package provided with its updates&amp;rsquo; notifications, which unlike pacman that would have required to manually tweak checking for these updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it&amp;rsquo;s usually the case, pacman was downright correct by identifying as closely as possible the culprit by which the system itself held &lt;code&gt;files already in filesystem&lt;/code&gt;. This was clearly the case with the package &lt;strong&gt;gtk-doc&lt;/strong&gt;, and somehow this conflict had to be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I don&amp;rsquo;t know, and it&amp;rsquo;s my mistake since I didn&amp;rsquo;t venture out - either at the time when it first occurred -, and much less now, because it&amp;rsquo;d be a wildly-guessing why would this be the case, that even when two systems configured alike which in turn held the same package revisions,  were somehow behaving disparagingly different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was not able to remove it [gtk-doc], by invoking pacman alone - as there was another error that disallowed me to do so. And I was simply sloppy back then, as I&amp;rsquo;m perhaps now to single out and summarize each of the problems that had I encountered during the installation for the new version of pamac, and to to have kept  working errors&amp;rsquo; copies handy, as this would have provided a somewhat more acceptable idea where the problem lied at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did however, tried to stay as far away as possible from manually  removing  each of the files installed by the package [gtk-doc], but unfortunately after many unsuccessful attempts to install another pamac version, this predictable painstaking process, that of having to go and remove each file owned by the package,  seemed to be the only inevitable method to circumvent this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going through each subsequent step during removal and by successfully reinstalling the same package over again, pamac has been working - so far - without a glitch. If it stays as such, is yet to be determined. I could no longer assure it&amp;hellip; but it gives me pause and comfort in knowing that &lt;code&gt;checking inter-dependencies&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;checking file-conflcts&lt;/code&gt; rolling hangs haven&amp;rsquo;t returned to this annoyingly halting process.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pamac Error While Loading Shared Libraries Libalpm</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libalpm/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2019 02:37:53 EDT</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libalpm/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/libalpm.3.html&#34;&gt;Libalpm&lt;/a&gt; is the library for package management of Arch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it funny that in case of any bugs the team says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bugs? You must be kidding; there are no bugs in this software. But if we happen to be wrong, submit a bug report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they&amp;rsquo;re right. When it comes to package management handling, Arch offers unlike any other one out there, the quirks and perks that not even a propietary  coding scheme such as Homebrew, Fink, Macports from OSX Cocoa could even think to come close during its best moments. This is not to illegitimize whatever accomplishments have been put together by these teams, but it&amp;rsquo;s still disparately sub-par compared to what Arch has offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the last kernel update there was a problem with  pamac though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firing it up from the terminal was simply returning an&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which considering how lazy I&amp;rsquo;ve become over the years, and even more so after reading articles a few years ago such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_Google_Making_Us_Stupid%3F&#34;&gt;Is Google making us stupid&lt;/a&gt; by Atlantic technology writer Nicholas Carr, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to gobble it up or try to leave it up to Google to offer the best match to this undesired behavior I was getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first query by the algorithms of Google returned an issue over at &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Jguer/yay/issues/1087&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;yay: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thinking about it again, the issue pertained mostly to &lt;a href=&#34;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; aur.archlinux.org/packages/yay/&lt;/a&gt; which I&amp;rsquo;ve never installed. Perhaps I had done it years earlier on another different system, but not on the current machines I&amp;rsquo;ve been running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second queried result though, took me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://rtfm.co.ua/en/arch-linux-package-query-error-while-loading-shared-libraries-libalpm-so-11-2/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Arch Linux: package-query: error while loading shared libraries: libalpm.so.11&lt;/a&gt;, but as soon as I read about making a symbolic link, which the author of article rightfully pointed out that although it could be done,  is not recommended and just plain wrong to go that route..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other solution from the same article, involved reinstalling &lt;a href=&#34;https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/package-query/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; aur package query&lt;/a&gt;, but then again, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have package-query on that particular system&amp;hellip;. and unfortunaetly reinstalling pamac didn&amp;rsquo;t resolve the issue as he had stated it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downloading the newest version and configuring it later on did the trick&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow it seemed that during the latest upgrade, the installation of  pamac, which occured during the same kernel upgrade and which it was done  by the interface itself did not go as planned&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This had to be done again not only with &lt;code&gt;makepkg&lt;/code&gt; but with a newer version, in order to have it running again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Arch Linux Javaws No Such File or Directory</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/arch-linux-javaws-no-such-file-or-directory/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:58:13 EDT</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/arch-linux-javaws-no-such-file-or-directory/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Trying to get &lt;code&gt;javaws&lt;/code&gt; to work without a glitch on one of the systems it was tested under, proved to be a chore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executable file was not being recognized in this case, which consequently led me to believe, that during the installation of the program, the path somehow had not been set by the libraries that&amp;rsquo;d normally take care of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the libraries for which &lt;code&gt;javaws&lt;/code&gt; depended upon and for which it was being tested even under a different system seemed to have been installed. This included, &lt;strong&gt;jdk8-openjdk..&lt;/strong&gt; and its counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, during the installation, the path that had been set for &lt;code&gt;javaws&lt;/code&gt; had been incorrectly identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/javaws line 197: no such file or directory.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon further inspection of the line in question, is hard to pinpoint whether therein lied the problem or not&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon going ahead and after opening the &lt;code&gt;javaws&lt;/code&gt; executable, I noticed that the path had been incorrectly set indeed by either some of the libraries during the initialization&amp;hellip;. It was pointing out to a different location &lt;strong&gt;rather&lt;/strong&gt; than where the files for the java environment were located instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying the file in question and instructing it to open up without further ado, seemed to resolve the problem. Thus &lt;code&gt;java=/location/of/java/default/&lt;/code&gt; worked without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pacman-unable-to-lock-database/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On a recent pacman upgrade, I encountered the error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;:: Synchronizing package databases...
error: failed to update core (unable to lock database)
error: failed to update extra (unable to lock database)
error: failed to update community (unable to lock database)
error: failed to synchronize all databases
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;the solution everytime is to remove the &lt;code&gt;db.lck&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;code&gt;/var/lib/&lt;/code&gt; directory and restart pacman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;rm /var/lib/db.lck
pacman -Syyu

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Forwarding an email is a function usually  bound to the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; key, but if there are any Attachments that were included on the email, high chances are,  that the attachments will not be selected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could go directly to the attachments in question and selectively open each one of them. This in turn, will select the attachments, save the body of the email that had been sent on the original email. To do this, one would have to further select the remainder from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If various attachments are part of the email though, this otherwise seemingly
simple task, may be somewhat inconvenient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the workarounds is to have &lt;code&gt;Esc-e&lt;/code&gt; that uses the
current message as a template for a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/xterm-crashes-with-ctrl-mouse-combination/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seemed as if there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of conflict by bringing up the menu on the xterm terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+ 🖱 (rightmouse) is usually the way that one would bring the
menu, but every time this was done, &lt;strong&gt;xterm&lt;/strong&gt; was crashing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going over some of the &lt;strong&gt;xorg-fonts-&lt;/strong&gt;* packages, I noticed that some of
them were not installed for the X system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them,  &lt;strong&gt;xorg-fonts-misc&lt;/strong&gt; was not installed. I
proceeded to install it and the menu was brought up
successfully again by the &lt;kbd&gt;ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; rightmouse
🖱combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bug report was properly sent out to address this issue. I don&amp;rsquo;t recall from having this issue before, and/or when it even first appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kakoune Macros Recording and Replay</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/kakoune-macros-recording-and-replay/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 06 Feb 2019 03:28:11 -0400</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/kakoune-macros-recording-and-replay/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the features for which I personally would have a use for, would
be macros recording and playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read about this on the doc page for &lt;strong&gt;kakoune&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;code&gt;:doc keys macros&lt;/code&gt;
might give you an idea that by default &lt;strong&gt;Q&lt;/strong&gt; starts or ends macro
recording, while &lt;strong&gt;q&lt;/strong&gt; replays it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;esc&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; key also ends the macro recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/keys.asciidoc#macros&#34;&gt;Kakoune
Macros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But further description for the macros recording and playback, is not
provided on the doc page for &lt;strong&gt;Kakoune&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author advises to consult the &lt;code&gt;:doc registers&lt;/code&gt; for further info.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the doc states&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Registers are named lists of text -instead of simply text- in order to
interact well with multiselection. They are used for various purposes,
like storing the last yanked text, or the captured groups associated
with the selections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And about interacting with it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;c-r&amp;gt;&amp;lt;c&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; when in insert mode or in a prompt, insert the value stored
in the c register (single character)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&amp;lt;c&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; in normal mode, select the register (single character)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike &lt;strong&gt;vim&lt;/strong&gt; in which a macro is replayed by preceding the
register with the macro &lt;strong&gt;@&lt;/strong&gt;, on &lt;strong&gt;kakoune&lt;/strong&gt;, the double quote along
with register &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;key&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; must precede the macro key, which in this case is
&lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; that&#39;s bound to the default register &lt;strong&gt;@&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignorant of this fact, mixed with the confusion that stemmed primarily
from the habit of using a workflow from &lt;strong&gt;vim&lt;/strong&gt;, disallowed me to fully
comprehend that in order to replay the macro, the register (whatever
this one may be) must supersede the double quote &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;, followed in the
end by the default register &lt;code&gt;q&lt;/code&gt; which in turn, fully replays the
specified macro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After going over it, this may simply seem to have been just an oversight
on my part since such an obvious step to record and replay the macro, is
evident, but considering I&#39;ve been used to &lt;strong&gt;vim&lt;/strong&gt;, it was not at all
clear at first, what the steps may have been, mainly in order to replay
the macro on Normal mode. On &lt;strong&gt;Insert&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt; mode, however,
the documentation provided all the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So to record the macro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;quot; &amp;lt;key&amp;gt; Q &amp;lt;esc&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And to replay the macro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; &amp;quot; &amp;lt;key&amp;gt; q 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;!--# Kakoune Invoke Shell Program on Buffer {#kakoune-invoke-shell-program-on-buffer .post-title}

[Feb 5, 2019]{.post-date}
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I seldom use the text editor kakoune. But many of the features that I have
found with vim or neovim for that matter in the past, have finally been
implemented on this editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is, however, one of the best modal editors currently in development
and I encourage anyone who may be interested on the modality of these
sort of editors, to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to see how well this editor handled key mappings to invoke a
command from within the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map keys doc which can be found at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/mapping.asciidoc&#34;&gt;mapping.ascii&lt;/a&gt;
specifies that &lt;code&gt;map [switches] &amp;lt;scope&amp;gt; &amp;lt;mode&amp;gt; &amp;lt;key&amp;gt; &amp;lt;keys&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; would be the
recomme nded way to map a key to the desired parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further googling about this issue, led me to a post at &lt;a href=&#34;https://discuss.kakoune.com/t/how-to-execute-shell-commands-with-the-current-file-name/&#34;&gt;how to execute
shell commands with the current
filename&lt;/a&gt;
in which a user asked for a similar configuration on the kakrc
initialization file to invoke a command within the shell for the current
buffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unfortunately the suggested recommendation for a latex file in this
case, would not work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, the WinSetOption variable must have a normal mode to
which the key is mapped to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the correct way to map the key would be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map global normal &amp;lt;c-x&amp;gt; &#39;:w&amp;lt;ret&amp;gt; $ latex $kak_buffile&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, &lt;strong&gt;ctrl&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;x&lt;/strong&gt; are bound to save the file and invoke
the shell command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If other options are needed then specify it accordingly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/blob/master/doc/pages/mapping.asciidoc&#34;&gt;kakoune
mapping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reply to Email With Mutt on Xfce</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reply-to-email-with-mutt-on-xfce/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 01 Feb 2019 01:35:59 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reply-to-email-with-mutt-on-xfce/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After looking at various ways to reply to an email address through mutt along with the terminal of choice, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/exo/preferred-applications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xfce docs website&lt;/a&gt; did not provide me with all the needed details in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that by going to &lt;strong&gt;Preferred Applications&lt;/strong&gt; one would have to further specify the corresponding commands under the &lt;strong&gt;Mail Reader&lt;/strong&gt; application. But although it did pointed this out by running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator mutt
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the terminal, this, however, does not work. The terminal of choice will not open accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further queries about this problem led me to a post from the Northern Virginia Linux Users Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/033997.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, one of the users pointed out that by launching, say, &lt;strong&gt;xterm&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;-e&lt;/strong&gt; option, this would be more than enough to open the file in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; exo-open --launch &#39;xterm -e&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is wrong, since &lt;strong&gt;TerminalEmulator&lt;/strong&gt; needs to be specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/034003.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; closely related under the same thread, another user specified that the &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash;launch&lt;/strong&gt; option needed a &amp;ldquo;category.&amp;rdquo; It wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be difficult to find out what the category he was referring to, may be. In this case, even the already mentioned link from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.firemountain.net/pipermail/novalug/2013-January/033997.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xfce docs&lt;/a&gt; had already pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The man page for &lt;a href=&#34;https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/xterm.1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xterm&lt;/a&gt; says about the &lt;strong&gt;-e&lt;/strong&gt; option that it will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; -e program [ arguments ... ]
 This option specifies the program (and its command line arguments) to be run in the xterm window. It also sets the window title and icon name to be the basename of the program being executed if neither -T nor -n are given on the command line.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To wrap it all up, quotes &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt; are indeed needed to call out the preferred terminal - which in my case is xterm - and finally bring out the mail reader. The option &lt;strong&gt;-e&lt;/strong&gt; is needed as well, along with the path to the mutt configuration file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator &#39;xterm mutt -f /path/to/configuration/file &amp;quot;%s&amp;quot;&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or if one is using neomutt, change the &lt;strong&gt;-f&lt;/strong&gt; option accordingly to &lt;strong&gt;-F&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; exo-open --launch TerminalEmulator &#39;xterm neomutt -F /path/to/configuration/file &amp;quot;%s&amp;quot;&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Closetag Vim on Markdown Filetype</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/closetag-vim-on-markdown-filetype/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Dec 2018 00:43:33 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/closetag-vim-on-markdown-filetype/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I coudln&amp;rsquo;t help but noticing that the closetag plugin script for vim wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on any of the markdown files that had been previously edited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The markdown files in question were of the abbreviated form &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; and not &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It did work without a problem on any newly-created file and whether these files were of the form or had the extension &lt;code&gt;md&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The README file of &lt;strong&gt;closetag&lt;/strong&gt; specifies that in order for the plugin to work, it should be further specified as such on the initialization file with something such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; let g:closetag_filenames = &amp;quot;*.html, *.xhtml, *.phtml&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;etcetera. &lt;a href=&#34;#closetagreadme&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;closetagreadmeref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one given point I recall having &lt;code&gt;*.md&lt;/code&gt;, which was more than enough for the &lt;strong&gt;closetag&lt;/strong&gt; plugin to work without a problem, even with previously edited files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around however, only having &lt;code&gt;*.md&lt;/code&gt; did not remedy the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having &lt;code&gt;*.markdown&lt;/code&gt; on the vim initialization file was necessary for the
&lt;strong&gt;closetag&lt;/strong&gt; plugin to work with previously edited markdown files that held a
suffix &lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt; extension&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; let g:closetag_filenames = &amp;quot;*.md, *.mardown&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;closetagreadme&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag/blob/master/README.md#options&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;README file for closetag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#closetagreadmeref&#34;&gt;↵ &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Error While Reinstalling All Previously Deployed Packages of Context User</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-while-reinstalling-all-previously-deployed-packages-of-context-user/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 01:25:37 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/error-while-reinstalling-all-previously-deployed-packages-of-context-user/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I still don&amp;rsquo;t know whether there was an old installation of Libreoffice sitting somewhere on the system. But a new fresh installation not only failed to start up but it also returned the message error &lt;code&gt;Error while reinstalling all previously deployed packages of context user&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking up Google didn&amp;rsquo;t help in finding some sort of recent info about this issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also had a &lt;code&gt;warning: failed to load path from javadlx&lt;/code&gt; which was obviously only a warning but nonetheless troublesome and problematic considering that this was just a fresh installation of Libreoffice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further looking up this issue through Google led me to the forum of Arch in which a user mentioned the possibility of permission problems with the installation. The user also queried Google to find more about this issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling about the error showed some chances of being a permission problem with ~/.openoffice.org2. But I don&amp;rsquo;t have that directory in my system, but ~/.config/.libreoffice. I would suggest you check the permissions on this directory. Mine are 766. &lt;a href=&#34;#javadlx&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;javadlxref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but there was nothing out of the norm with the permissions set on the directory. But from his post it reminded me that usually the path that is set by xdg is under the &lt;strong&gt;xdg&lt;/strong&gt; directory. Then again, the environment variable for it had been set correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go ahead and back up the &lt;code&gt;.config/libreoffice/4&lt;/code&gt; directory where some of the other files for libreoffice laid at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I moved that directory with all the files to another location, following by calling out &lt;code&gt;libreoffice&lt;/code&gt; which seemed to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first hits provided by Google after my first inquiry, were from the forums at the libreoffice website itself, in which one of the threads that also dealt with this issue had mentioned the same workaround that I had just used. See more at &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.openoffice.org/en/forum/viewtopic.php?f=101&amp;t=83995&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LO5.0 Fatal Error cannot be started&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href=&#34;#oocontextuser&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;oocontextuserref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further queries that would shed more light about this problem, took me to a previous probable bug that was reported to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugs.documentfoundation.org/show_bug.cgi?id=64606&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentfoundation.org&lt;/a&gt; website. This report was opened on 2013 and closed right after around 2014. &lt;a href=&#34;#docfoundation&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;docfoundationref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why that bug report at the documentfoundation.org website was marked as closed shortly after it was reported, is simply beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report occurred under version 5 whereas in my case, it was under version 6. And the problem is still there.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sddm Wayland Timezone Differs From Locale</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/sddm-wayland-timezone-differs-from-locale/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 02 Nov 2018 02:16:00 EDT</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/sddm-wayland-timezone-differs-from-locale/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A slowdown on my hardware had recently made me to reconsider another display manager that would presumably improve the boot time of my system. But even after installing it, I could not see any discernible difference between these display greeters. Perhaps I had noticed it before a year or so ago when I tried it out and went ahead and enabled it on an older system. This time around though, my expectations fell short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/SDDM#Configuration_GUI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SDDM&lt;/a&gt;, I called out systemd to disable &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/LightDM&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LightDM&lt;/a&gt; with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; sytemctl disable lightdm.service 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;followed by the enabling of the newly installed display manager with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; systemctl enable sddm.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear at first, but just after rebooting the system - although at this point my faulty memory is not helping me remember whether it was a reboot or by logging out of the system, that I noticed that the timezone differed from that of the desktop environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it was SDDM Wayland that got it right this time around and not the DE XFCE according to the locale currently in use. The timezone that SDDM picked up and hence the entry that was returned after calling out &amp;rsquo;timedatectl&amp;rsquo; were the same. The reasoning behind this assumption is that by calling out the &lt;code&gt;timedatectl status&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_time#Time_zone&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Wiki suggested&lt;/a&gt;, returned indeed what was expected, albeit wrongly set at one point by me, but nonetheless correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; datetimectl status
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;matched SDDM clock settings. The timezone had been incorrectly set at one point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modifying the timezone accordingly seemed to have resolved the issue with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;timedatectl set-timezone Zone/SubZone
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All in all, some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=207550&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posts from Arch Forums&lt;/a&gt; that were queried via Google, were slightly off topic. Some of these &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=112137&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;posts&lt;/a&gt; for example dealt primarily with clock twelve and twenty four hour clock settings, whereas in my case it the underlying cause was primarily due with the timezone set incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further posts that came up for XFCE were also from the long-standing threads at &lt;strong&gt;linuxquestions.org&lt;/strong&gt;, a site that has been around perhaps longer than any other out there related to GNU/Linux in general. This time around the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-software-2/adjusting-the-clock-in-xfce-4175528816/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;user was running AntiX&lt;/a&gt;  and not systemd. The &lt;code&gt;timedatectl&lt;/code&gt; is part of the latter in this case, so the suggestions aimed at &lt;code&gt;hwclock&lt;/code&gt; or setting it also through &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that is relatively easy to mess up the time settings on the system as this question from stackexchange pointed out. See for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/60772/i-messed-up-my-system-clock-in-arch-linux&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I messed up my system clock in Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other questions that dealt with XFCE and not necessarily with SDDM, pretty much coincided with the &lt;code&gt;timedatectl&lt;/code&gt; command. Like for example the following question that was also on &lt;strong&gt;stackexchange&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/296776/how-can-i-easily-change-my-time-zone-in-arch-xfce&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;How can I easily change my time-zone in Arch/Xfce&lt;/a&gt; that I came across only later and after resolving it first in my end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And still, the best way and proven methodology I know of, and one which deals with the time/date issue on an Arch Linux system is by the aforementioned method outlined above. Credit where the credit is due, because all the credit goes to the &lt;strong&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/strong&gt; for making it accessible without having to read through an entire manual to resolve an outstanding problem as simple as a timezone. Although I have to acknowledge that reading &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; pages is the optimal and thorough alternative to get a deep understanding of an entire system. Nothing comes close as the latter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/System_time#Time_zone&#34; target=&#34;_blnak&#34;&gt;System Time Arch Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/clamav-freshclam-update-definitions/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ClamAV arch linux wiki&lt;/a&gt; states, &lt;strong&gt;ClamAV&lt;/strong&gt; is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clam AntiVirus is an open source (GPL) anti-virus toolkit for UNIX. It provides a number of utilities including a flexible and scalable multi-threaded daemon, a command line scanner and advanced tool for automatic database updates. Because ClamAV&amp;rsquo;s main use is on file/mail servers for Windows desktops, it primarily detects Windows viruses and malware with its built-in signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to update the definitions correctly is important to run first&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; freshclam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which should then start the update&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ClamAV update process started at Tue Aug 28 01:16:43 2018
 Downloading main.cvd [100%]

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then an error came up saying that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; WARNING: Clamd was NOT notified: Can&#39;t connect to clamd through /run/clamav/clamd.ctl: No such file or directory
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which left me unsure what could have been the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling about it returned among many of the results, some as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-server-73/can%27t-connect-to-unix-socket-var-run-clamav-clamd-ctl-connection-refused-856847/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t connect to Unix socket /var/run//clamav/clamd.ctl&lt;/a&gt;, which dealt with the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error here in which it dealt with &lt;strong&gt;clamd.ctl&lt;/strong&gt; and not with &lt;strong&gt;clamd.sock connect ()&lt;/strong&gt; as it was posted on the entry entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Error:_Clamd_was_NOT_notified&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Error Clamd was not notified&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after running&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  freshclam
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had already forgotten to start/enable &lt;code&gt;clamav-freshclam.service&lt;/code&gt; as outlined on the Wiki &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/ClamAV#Updating_database&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ClamAV updating database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; systemctl start clamav-freshclam.service
 systemctl enable clamav-freshclam.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/clamav-freshclam.service → /usr/lib/systemd/system/clamav-freshclam.service.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on by calling the status of that service with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; systemctl status clamav-freshclam.service
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;returned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Aug 28 01:23:43  systemd[1]: Started ClamAV virus database upda&amp;gt;
 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: ClamAV update process started&amp;gt;
 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: main.cvd is up to date (versi&amp;gt;
 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: daily.cvd is up to date (vers&amp;gt;
 Aug 28 01:23:43  freshclam[]: bytecode.cvd is up to date
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But whether it would be necessary to enable it every time it restarts, it&amp;rsquo;s something that I will deal with later on. I only needed it this time around to check some files, and that was the purpose of running it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hunspell-en in Conflict With Hunspell en_US</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/hunspell-en-in-conflict-with-hunspell-en_us/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Aug 2018 23:56:45 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/hunspell-en-in-conflict-with-hunspell-en_us/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On a different machine running the latest updates from Arch, pacman would give the error (and rightly so) that &lt;code&gt;hunspell-en and hunspell-en_US are in conflict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;could not satisfy dependencies&lt;/code&gt; followed by &lt;code&gt;removing hunspell-en breaks dependency hunspell-en required by **antergos-common-meta**&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was of course never a problem on the other machine in which &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; was removed a while back. For the simple reason that the update related to anything &lt;strong&gt;hunspell&lt;/strong&gt; was in this particular case only for &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_US&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-es_any&lt;/strong&gt; but not for, and this is important to note: &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en&lt;/strong&gt;. The latter includes all English dictionaries for US, UK, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the question is how to resolve this impeding conflict during the updates? Simply by skipping the package on pacman during the updates, or simply by deselecting the packages that belong to &lt;em&gt;hunspell-en&lt;/em&gt; on pamac (the gui version for pacman) for which the conflict exists in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; pacman -Su IgnorePkg=hunspell-en_US
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman#Skip_package_from_being_upgraded&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skip package from being upgraded&lt;/a&gt; on the Arch Wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By removing &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; the first time around on this particular
as I had done a few weeks ago on the other machine, made no difference. And
that&amp;rsquo;s the reason as to why the above is recommended. That is, by skipping the
packages in question that belong to &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_US&lt;/strong&gt; for example first, and
then by proceeding with the updates normally seems to be the most reasonable
method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once this is done, the next step would be to remove &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en&lt;/strong&gt; which would also remove &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; by which the latter package relies on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the next step would be in installing the libraries for &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_US&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_GB&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_AU&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en_CA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, in the latest installation ISO image, this issue with &lt;strong&gt;hunspell&lt;/strong&gt; and its dependencies has not been removed from the repositories that the installation media uses for the initial process. Which better explains as to why on the other machine which had the most recent Antergos installation, this problem was still present, whereas with the other machine in which I had removed &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; which removed &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-en&lt;/strong&gt; - the one that bundles all dictionaries for the English language - was never experienced.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setup Network Printer Ip Address Port Number</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/setup-network-printer-ip-address-port-number/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 10 Aug 2018 01:31:19 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/setup-network-printer-ip-address-port-number/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up a network printer seems not only problematic on Arch based systems, but also on Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter also gave me the proverbial run for the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after I thought that the network printer had be configured correctly, errors such as &lt;code&gt;there was a problem processing document&lt;/code&gt; after printing a test page, or simply the error stating that &lt;code&gt;the printer may not be connected&lt;/code&gt; assured me that the network printer was not being correctly identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ommon &lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;nix &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rinting &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ervices or as its acronym that is better known for: CUPS, is without a doubt, the most reliable method to set up any printer, and especially those that depend upon a network to operate accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not the first time setting up a network printer through CUPS, but
contrary to the first time around when the printer was successfully configured
on the system, in which the ip address had to be specified, and the connection
port number of the socket was automatically picked up by CUPS, this time around
however, specifying the ip address by itself made no difference with further
configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The printer was still not recognized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I scoured Google for any relevant results that would help me troubleshoot the problem, but none of the results seemed to provide a definitive answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arch Linux Forums was one of the first indicators that this issue was beyond a driver problem and rather a misconfiguration with the network printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the thread entitled &lt;em&gt;Printer setting cant find wireless printer&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1605184#p1605184&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reply provided&lt;/a&gt; gave a couple of hints as to where to begin to troubleshot the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your post is much too vague. What does your wireless printer advertise? You should be able to add it using its IP address in the CUPS interface like this: http://192.168.1.3. You need to replace 192.168.1.3 by the IP of your printer and http:// could be socket:// lpd:// or something else&amp;hellip; Maybe you also have to specify a port number like this: http://192.168.1.3:9100. If you can setup the printer in another OS (for example Windows); you might be able to find these by examining the properties of the printer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Windows however, is that Windows itself does not provide a simple port configuration method that would have allowed me to see the ip address and the port that was currently in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around CUPS had already specified the ip address and the connection for the socket. But everything else for even the location had already been noted. Furthermore, I double checked it against the settings for the wireless configuration of the printer. Not solely relying on whatever configuration the display showed but also by printing out right from the printer the specifics of the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I ventured out to get a glimpse through a Windows system that would allow me to double check the settings, I encountered though, an unforeseen &lt;code&gt;An error occurred during port configuration. This operation is not supported&lt;/code&gt; which prevented me any further from finding out about the ip address and port number configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/windows-port-error-configuration.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This however, was not expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this question that was brought up on the stackexchange network, the user asked &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/140009/list-all-network-printers-including-ones-not-installed&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;to list all network printers (including ones not installed)&lt;/a&gt; and although it hinted that the program &lt;strong&gt;lpstat&lt;/strong&gt; with the flag &lt;code&gt;-a&lt;/code&gt; was one that would undertake the task, as the user pointed out, this would not apply to those printers that have not been installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another command that would certainly come handy is &lt;code&gt;lpinfo -v&lt;/code&gt; but more than what it provided was therefore needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another thread entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;linux - how do you get the name of a network printer&lt;/a&gt; one of the comments said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I run the nmap command it never seems to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer#comment836711_662485&#34;&gt;https://superuser.com/questions/662418/how-do-i-get-the-name-of-a-network-printer#comment836711_662485&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which pretty much matches many of the issues that I have encountered with the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only workaround with this pervasive problem of a printer that depends solely on the network, is through some sort of initial setup performed namely through a Windows system that would point it out. Unlike Linux with its &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;ommon &lt;strong&gt;U&lt;/strong&gt;nix &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rinting &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;ervices in which by just confirming the correct ip address and port numbers of the printer are under , is more than enough to identify it accordingly.  Until then, and just like a user on the Arch Forums said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem here is that the criteria (&amp;ldquo;Network Printer&amp;rdquo;) is something that only makes sense to humans. Computer programs aren&amp;rsquo;t going to have a clear sense of that idea. You might try doing a network sweep for IP addresses that successfully connect on the JetDirect port (tcp/9100). The list is still likely to be incomplete in the case of non-JetDirect printers such as desktop printers shared over SMB. – Bratchley Jun 30 &amp;lsquo;14 at 18:16&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Directory Permissions Differ on Var Cache Pkgfile</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/directory-permissions-differ-on-var-cache-pkgfile/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Aug 2018 02:49:21 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/directory-permissions-differ-on-var-cache-pkgfile/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last updates through pacman the following message came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; warning: directory permissions differ on /var/cache/pkgfile/
 filesystem: 775  package: 755
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to first understand why this came up in the first place is good to know that &lt;code&gt;pkgfile&lt;/code&gt; is a tool for searching files in the official repos. &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pkgfile&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pkgfile - ArchLinux wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the question as to why the &lt;strong&gt;pkgfile&lt;/strong&gt; differs for the file system hierarchy and the package itself has come up before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/falconindy/pkgfile/issues/25&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; on Github dealt with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the thread, one of the users reported whether it was necessary for &lt;strong&gt;pkgfile&lt;/strong&gt; to create the directory if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course this is not the case here, but upon closer look on the pacman log it could be seen that &lt;strong&gt;pkgconf&lt;/strong&gt; had just been upgraded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; upgraded pkgconf (1.5.2-1 -&amp;gt; 1.5.3-1)
 warning: directory permissions differ on /var/cache/pkgfile/
 filesystem: 775  package: 755
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which suggests that right after the updates it didn&amp;rsquo;t recreate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand &lt;strong&gt;pkgconf&lt;/strong&gt; is according to the manual pages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; pkgconf is a program which helps to configure compiler and
 linker flags for development libraries.  This allows build
 systems to detect other dependencies and use them with the
 system toolchain.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see for example what the aforementioned &lt;a href=&#34;Github https://github.com/falconindy/pkgfile/issues/25#issuecomment-227413406&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; issue on Github&lt;/a&gt; said about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a quick Google search would return among many of the results, the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=317732#p317732&#34;&gt;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=317732#p317732&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=223190&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; which in turn redirected to &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=218133&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With due credit to where credit is due, the following post from the Manjaro community explicitly said that it was a warning and not an error itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;xabbu 2018-06-10 21:39:39 UTC #4
directory permissions differ on &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message is a warning and not an error. This is normally not a problem. It just says that the permissions of a folder in a package differ form the permissions of that folder on your system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally this will not result in a problem, however you should change the permissions to the package defaults to avoid future problems. This message is shown every time you update this package if the permissions don’t match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your specific case, at the moment only root and members of the group locate have access to the mlocate folder. With the change to 755 everybody can access and read the content of that folder. This don’t necessary mean everybody has also read access to the files in that folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the package folder contains different permissions than your system folder can have several reasons. Often it is because the upstream source have changed permissions. Sometimes a developer does this on purpose. But sometimes this happens by mistake and is changed back with the next release. Also the Maintainer can change the permissions of files and folder in the build process.
And of course the user sometimes changes the permissions of a file or folder and forget about or does it to fix a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also please note (@jochen82 @farverio ), if you have a problem with something else start a new thread with your problem to get help with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On another thread on the same Manjaro forums this came up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;fhdk 2018-05-07 10:34:00 UTC #4
rrrsssttt:
directory permissions differ on /var/lib/samba/private/
filesystem: 755 package: 700
bill_t:
It means that the permissions of this directory must be set to 755 (or drwxr-xr-x).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually it means the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filesystem is 755 when the package expects it to be 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the right thing to do is to set permissions as the package expects it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sudo chmod 700 /var/lib/samba/private/
rrrsssttt:
I want to clarify that I don’t believe I have ever touched that folder (I may have installed apps that have touched it, but I consciously never have)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don’t need to. It is probably a fix since the folder mentioned is named private and as such is a folder that samba uses for stuff like certificates, keys, private keys, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such folder is only accessible for the system service running samba and the service will presumably refuse to run if permissions is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try that with your .gnupg folder or the .ssh folder. If permissions is world readable you will get complaints from application and some even refuses to run unless only accessible by owner aka chmod 700 ~/.ssh -R as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;see &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.manjaro.org/t/i-got-a-warning-after-running-the-latest-round-of-updates-im-confused-what-to-do-next/46651&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I get a warning after running the latest round of updates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the user on the Manjaro Forum pointed out when he/she said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually it means the opposite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing the directory permissions of the package in question in the file system with a &lt;code&gt;chmod 755&lt;/code&gt; would be the best course of action for this package permission issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that the reason why it occurs in the first place, is due to the fact that the tool &lt;strong&gt;pkgfile&lt;/strong&gt; must have administrative privileges during installation/upgrade in order to continue. That is, writing, reading and executing. But once the update has finished it no longer is necessary to keep the same permissions than before. The package no longer needs to have access to the home of the user in question.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Linux Market Share Pitfalls: data manipulation and non-existent ranking markers</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/linux-market-share-pitfalls/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 02:50:35 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/linux-market-share-pitfalls/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago someone whom I came across on a technical forum
was vouching so much for one of the most used/popular Linux
Distributions that he/she almost gave the impression of
fully endorsing the distro in question, without further
proof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said that he/she stated it without further proof because
all distributions consist of several software which make up
the whole system. So it would be gullible to think that one
particular distro employs Free Software while clearly
stating that the rest of the license by which the distro
developers go aheaad and implement it, is - as a result - within the
framework of say for example, what the Free Software
Foundation accepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the case. Most Linux distros, and even more
those that are amongst the most popular, are not very clear
in their terms with the programs that the distro&amp;rsquo; s
developers include and consequently employ within it, for further mass
use. No distribution out there but only a handful of them do
this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem that the above presents to the adoption of the Free
Software license is that many of these distributions do not uphold
licenses as they should or simply because its developers have included
other elements such as firmware nonfree blobs, or have provided
ambiguously writing in the documentation, and have offered other
methods that have provided download venues which in turn officially
endorse nonfree programs. More information about this can be seen on
the article entitled &lt;em&gt;Explaining Why We Don&amp;rsquo;t Endorse Other Systems&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;#nonfree&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;nonfreeref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posted on the Free
Software Foundation website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the poor statements that this user was trying to make about one of
the most popular Linux distributions at the time, could no longer hold
valid together under the license for which the Free Software
Foundation stands upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further info about this, one could visit the Free
Software Foundation to get a glimpse at what this is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to make matters even worse, the user who was trying to
make his silly point, brought up one if not the most
inaccurate and misleading source of Linux Market Share
measure rankings&amp;rsquo; markers out there, a website named
&lt;strong&gt;Distrowatch&lt;/strong&gt; that lists the most popular GNU/Linux
distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which takes me to the second rant about why the above cannot be taken as an
statistical absolute. For &lt;strong&gt;Distrowatch&lt;/strong&gt; is just a community driven, heavily
edited, bureaucratically biased reviewed epicenter which sits on the web  with
layers of html markup with a domain registration.  Let me emphasize once again
about its biased one sided view about the certain distros&amp;rsquo; Linux Market Share.
It is important to do so because it is almost and will always be imprecise to
measure the use of GNU/Linux distributions across the spectrum and compare
these - whether community or commercially based&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;with many of the most heard- Operating systems without reliable methods
and just by a simple likes/preferences which in the end, is nothing more than
a preconceived notion of what distro should and should not be on the top.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this, Distrowatch statement is vague to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Stack Frames: A Look From Inside&lt;/em&gt;, its author
said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each website has its own list of the most popular
distributions, updated on the basis of different criteria,
hence with different results. To give one example,
Linux Mint was the most popular distribution in
2013 and in the first half of 2014 according to
Distrowatch, but is ranked twelfth on the
LinuxCounter and LWN.  &lt;a href=&#34;#stack&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;stackref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is important because the disparity on numbers when
all the distributions are compared across LinuxCounter
&lt;a href=&#34;#linuxcounter&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;linuxcounterref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and LWN,  &lt;a href=&#34;#lwn&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;lwnref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
greatly differ from the ranking on Distrowatch. The differences would
be much more profound if other websites would try to gather
these numbers as long as the list is not heavily edited or
maintained by users who manipulate this data like in the case of
Distrowatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the LWN site, the author of &lt;em&gt;Stack Frames: A
Look From Inside&lt;/em&gt;, was also on the err side and may have
made some subtle mistakes with the rankings of the distros.
This may be noted with some of the inconsistencies with the
top market share of the distros in use. That is,  the
chronologically order of the distributions as it was
reflected on the book and as the author pointed out, is
certainly troublesome.  The list on LWN is enumerated
alphabetically and it does not necessarily offers numbers
that could be used as a better counter/measurement
tool/indicator/predictor in this case. It does show,
however, the mainstream distributions or the ones that have
been around the longest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commercial and community based - in the computing world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading about this pervasive problem with the market share
of GNU/Linux programs, and the distributions that include
these programs in addition to the share of these
distributions along with the biases that are taking place in
community sites such as Distrowatch, the author of a blog on
the Medium blogging service platform said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I notice when they have an axe to grind against a
particular distribution bad reviews are allowed to flourish
but if I or others submit positive reviews they tend to get
ignored and there are more than a handful of distributions
where I have noticed that trend&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what it&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate is that such misleading bits of information occur
nowadays, especially within the culture of the GNU/Linux Operating system which
even includes its kernel without which the vast GNU software which is comprised
of, accomplishes nothing.  But most importantly, listing it as so called &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo;
when most of the &amp;lsquo;popular&amp;rsquo; distributions do not even adhere to the Free
Software Foundation standards guidelines of Free Software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author in that blog stated that Distrowatch is biased towards
free-as-in-beer distributions, but I would disagree because I do think
the bias is there regardless whether is more commercially oriented by
which the distribution in question implements free software or not. It
is the case that community driven distros do not necessarily implement the
licenses any better than commercially based distros. But it makes no
difference in the case of this website. The users responsible to
update the counter list for the distros or in this case the distro
that should appear on the top are undoubtedly misinforming real/accurate market
share data without further repercussions. And by the looks of it, what
matters is the ad-driven commercially source of income that derives
from this data manipulation to the owner of Distrowatch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no idea whether this GNU/Linux user that commented about how
that Linux distro fared in comparison with the rest, was aware of
these facts, but Distrowatch in general has been around for a while
and I wonder whether they have affected the objective and the goal
overall of the Free Software Foundation Guidelines.&lt;br&gt;
No doubt that the reviews need further revision but they&amp;rsquo;re
doing so while promoting their own, without regard for the
particular distro and whether this is community-driven or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Linux Distribution Timeline offers in turn the progress
of the Linux Distributions and although is a great project
on its own right, it does not undertake where all the sites
have fallen short to accomplish this difficult task of having a
better Market Share Model that tackles the Linux world.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gscan2pdf Sane Start Invalid Argument</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gscan2pdf-sane-start-invalid-argument/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 24 Jul 2018 23:48:49 -0500</pubDate>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Antergos wins here. Manjaro could have done better but it
didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who would want to avoid having to go through the
hassle of reinstalling and testing sane drivers under Arch
Linux should look no further. The comparison wasn&amp;rsquo;t done
between all the Arch Linux based distributions, but Antergos
is the clear winner here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Desktop Environment under Manjaro worked to have this
driver functioning as it should have been functioning. And
this is after trying Manjaro KDE, Manjaro XFCE, the most
popular of the bunch. Didn&amp;rsquo;t try it with GNOME and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
going to waste my time with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps later versions would fare better, but this time
around it didn&amp;rsquo;t deliver what it was expected from this
distribution. The main issue had to do with the &lt;code&gt;invalid argument&lt;/code&gt; error message from programs such as &lt;strong&gt;gscan2pdf&lt;/strong&gt;
and also from &lt;strong&gt;xsane&lt;/strong&gt; and in identifying and picking up
the right device other than the infamous &lt;code&gt;Noname integrated camera&lt;/code&gt; that it would only identify from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-24_23-45-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reinstalling both Manjaro KDE and the XFCE version the
problem continued in identifying the correct device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-25_00-17-57.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Antergos it worked without a major issue and for that
reason alone I recommend this distribution over Manjaro.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pamac Runs Post Install Hooks but Fails to Install New Updates</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pamac-runs-post-install-hooks-but-fails-to-install-new-updates/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 21:31:56 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pamac-runs-post-install-hooks-but-fails-to-install-new-updates/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The GUI version of &lt;strong&gt;pacman&lt;/strong&gt; which runs under Antergos
installed the scheduled updates as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as soon as new updates were found it just failed to
install them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, after running the post installation hooks, it
found a new update for one of the programs. But this time
however, it failed to even initialized the transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although it could have been relatively simple to circumvent
the problem by seeing through &lt;strong&gt;pacman&lt;/strong&gt; itself what the error
was, but just closing the &lt;strong&gt;pamac&lt;/strong&gt; application, seemed all
that was needed to have the problem fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after, the GUI version &lt;strong&gt;pamac&lt;/strong&gt; had no further issues
to install the updates accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is is just a reminder not to fully rely on
&lt;strong&gt;pamac&lt;/strong&gt; and used the main package manager for any Arch
based distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Could Not Satisfy Dependencies Hunspell Antergos Common Meta</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/could-not-satisfy-dependencies-hunspell-antergos-common-meta/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 18 Jul 2018 00:12:54 -0500</pubDate>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/could-not-satisfy-dependencies-hunspell-antergos-common-meta/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It seems as if &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; has been removed
from some of the repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest updates by using pamac or even pacman returned
the &lt;em&gt;could not satisfy dependency&lt;/em&gt; error that was required
in this case for the hunspell Spanish dictionary &lt;strong&gt;hunspell-es&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/Screenshot_2018-07-17_23-51-16.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus by removing &lt;strong&gt;antergos-common-meta&lt;/strong&gt; or whatever was left
of it, resolved the problem, it seems that the Antergos
community haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to resolve some of these issues
that keep coming up every now and then with the
distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Google search about this problem returned, among the
results some posts like &lt;a
href=&#34;https://forum.antergos.com/topic/10303/cant-solve-dependencies-hunspell&#34;
target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t solve dependencies hunspell&lt;/a&gt; which
summarised the same error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike other occasions, I didn&amp;rsquo;t read about this particular issue this time, The reason for not following up on it is due to the fact that a few days ago a dependency problem had appeared about a &lt;code&gt;..libso.2&lt;/code&gt; (I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the name of the file, this time around), but it was a file that needed to be removed before successfully continuing with the updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the Antergos developers will be able to correct some
of these inconsistencies in an otherwise great distribution
that is based on Arch, before a greater share of users who are
fond of Arch, not only migrate to it, but fully adopt it as
the main OS in their systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then some of these errors and dependency satisfaction
from the packages would have to be resolved manually by the
end-users on their own.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Installing Pacman Breaks Dependency</title>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/installing-pacman-breaks-dependency/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Running one of the usual updates from the pamac gui package, returned&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; pamac: installing pacman (5.1.0-1) breaks dependency ‘pacman&amp;lt;5.1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that any package on the list with a dependency must be
unchecked before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I checked the antergos forum to see if there was any solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/pacman-cant-install-breaks-dependency.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggested workaround was to run&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; pacman -Syyu -d  --nodeps
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following commit apparently introduced the issue in the first
place:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/?id=e9272fcb3289f875b1a14222fb17f9185274107f&#34;&gt;https://git.archlinux.org/svntogit/packages.git/commit/?id=e9272fcb3289f875b1a14222fb17f9185274107f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Antergos Keyboard Selection During Installation</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/antergos-keyboard-selection-during-installation/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 27 Jan 2018 08:49:17 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/antergos-keyboard-selection-during-installation/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the drawbacks during the installation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://antergos.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Antergos Linux&lt;/a&gt; was in identifying the keyboard layout option that was previously selected during the media installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result only the default variant was being used after installing the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was able to identify the problem by going to the X window system xorg configuration file &lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.d/00-keyboard.conf&lt;/code&gt; and noticing that the &lt;strong&gt;XkbLayout&lt;/strong&gt; variant was not being properly identified as originally intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, only one of the options had been specified correctly on the &lt;code&gt;00-keyboard.conf&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found odd, is that on another system, which is by the way, running the same xfce environment from Antergos, the same problem was not encountered. On the other system, only one (1) variant was used, and it had correctly identified the layout twice, but on the system which after installing the Antergos media, loaded the incorrect values, two (2) variants were set accordingly, but only one (1) layout option was identified. In my case &lt;strong&gt;us&lt;/strong&gt; had been been identified once, whereas with the former no issues pertaining to this problem occurred in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the wiki &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Using X configuration files wiki&lt;/a&gt; recommends, not to modify any of the settings manually, but let instead &lt;strong&gt;localectl&lt;/strong&gt; handle it. &lt;a href=&#34;#sample&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;sampleref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-usage.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it comes handy when there is even an example that illustrates the process by using the correct parameters. For something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/00-keyboard-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then something like the following &lt;a href=&#34;#localectl&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;localectlref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on the previous example, suffices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/localectl-sample-usage.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set the values as deemed applicable to the desired customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;references&#34;&gt;References&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;sample&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg#Using_X_configuration_files&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Using X Configuration files 00-keyboard.conf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#sampleref&#34;&gt; &amp;#x21A9;&amp;#xFE0E;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Antergos Grub Selection</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/antergos-grub-selection/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 Jan 2018 08:38:47 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/antergos-grub-selection/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the installation of Antergos, there was an option to install the Linux LTS kernel along with the default latest stable version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though it was installed appropriately, the option to select the other kernel, could not be seen from the Grub selection window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is even after running the usual &lt;code&gt;mkinitcpio -p &amp;lt;linux kernel&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; that loads the modules and other dependencies accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s good to remember that Grub configuration file though, resides on the /boot/default directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With sudo privileges, access the file at /boot/default/grub first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therein, and lying at the bottom of the configuration file, one can find the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; # Uncomment to make GRUB remember the last selection. This requires to
 # set &#39;GRUB_DEFAULT=saved&#39; above.
 #GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&amp;quot;true&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could uncomment the GRUB_SAVEDEFAULT=&amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; so the grub configuration file ‘remembers’ the selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, and right on the top of the file the default chosen selection can be specified by modifying the value of 0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;grub-boot-loader-configuration&#34;&gt;GRUB boot loader configuration&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GRUB_DEFAULT=0
To a 2 or 3 for the desired kernel. Which in my case, and if the LTS kernel is to be loaded instead, matched the kernel itself and the fallback for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By going this route, it no longer is necessary in specifying during the system startup, the desired kernel that one chooses to be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember after making any changes to grub, to update the configuration file by running:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Udisks2 Udiskie Fares Better Than Ntfs 3g</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is my opinion, based mostly not on what I’ve read, but instead on what I’ve encountered during the handling of a failed hard disk, that the disk volume mounting utility udisks2 fares better than say, ntfs-3g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite possibly there could be many improvements with this software, and there is no doubt about it, but considering wear-and-tear conditions of the disk, among other considerations, and, as long as udisks2 is run without an interruption, no other mounting options utility that is currently available may be able to improve its overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If time is not a constraint, and the program is allowed to run on its own, udisks2 fares relatively better on previously loaded Windows OS partitions than any other. Of this I can attest without a doubt. The utility has been able to eventually access corrupted filesystems that would have been rendered unrecoverable otherwise&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Metadata Irreversible</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/metadata-irreversible/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the easiest ways to remove all metadata from a file, is by invoking &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/metadata-irreversible/#exiftool&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;refexiftool&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ exiftool -all= &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this has the inconvenience of providing a security risk by reversing it as well with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ exiftool -pdf-update:all= &amp;lt;file&amp;gt; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which pretty much inserts the metadata back into the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/exiftool-reversible-metadata-warning.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the author of &lt;strong&gt;exiftool&lt;/strong&gt; this can be circumvented by issuing &lt;code&gt;qpdf --linearize &amp;lt;file.in&amp;gt; &amp;lt;file.out&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. For further info about this see:

        <title>Manjaro Kde Plasma Dolphin Mtp Cant Open File</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-dolphin-mtp-cant-open-file/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 16 Dec 2017 13:26:25 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-dolphin-mtp-cant-open-file/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MTP&lt;/strong&gt; implementation runs on most desktop environments without a problem. Except on KDE where it has had several problems in identifying and initializing a simple file from any of the devices that have been connected to the system, mainly through the USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s really a shame that although Plasma KDE fairly supports Bluetooth protocol better than the rest of other desktop environments, it largely fails with both gwenview and its default Dolphin manager to open up files directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have tried in a great many occasions to slither out many of these KDE errors by falsely attributing it to my lack of knowledge on its usage. But I can’t deny any longer that the system either works or it doesn’t. And one should no longer have to wait who-knows-how-long-and-when, before updates smother out its deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have tried to look up for the issue elsewhere such as as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=177028&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;mtp mount issues in KDE/Dolphin&lt;/a&gt;, but many of the suggestions have not worked so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas with KDE, to my amazement - because at this point of its developmental phase, one would think that it should perform better and not worse - the problems all range from mild to critical, while &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; on the other hand, these unexpected malfunctions and sudden out-of-the-blue crashes do occur but at a lesser degree, and when one of these errors undermines the stability, the errors do not necessarily affect the overall functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experienced and spoke at somewhat length about a &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/&#34;&gt;manjaro kde error unknown application&lt;/a&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of recent Bluetooth vulnerabilities that have happened,&lt;a href=&#34;#blue&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;blueref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  and the history behind it in which several authors have researched the issue,&lt;a href=&#34;#tech&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;techref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it makes no sense to have a whole interface that handles this protocol better than most environments and yet fails when the to-be-expected approach to handle it differently or by using the right terminology, handling it without bluetooth at all in light of everything that has happened with it, by going directly through the use of the mtp protocol that is supposed to take care of it. Notice that mtp is supported without a major flaw in &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further reading about &lt;strong&gt;MTP&lt;/strong&gt;, is advisable to visit the formidable wiki from Arch Linux at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/MTP&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MTP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that kio-extras is a dependency of Kde’s dolphin file manager, which apparently is partly responsible for the &lt;code&gt;failed to initlialize&lt;/code&gt; error, but whichever is to be blamed in this regard, matters for as long as the user finds the KDE environment worthy to be used. In my case perhaps, the same opinion that for so long I’ve had of the software, has notably changed amid these recent problems: first with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/&#34;&gt;manjaro kde error unknown application instance as highlighted earlier&lt;/a&gt;, and now with the bluetooth problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps is worthy to revisit this desktop environment, but for now, it is in my opinion that there are better options out there from which to choose from, before having to put up with the inconsistencies and failures that have rendered the systems I have been running lately, useless in more than one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manjaro Kde Plasma Error Unknown Application Folder</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 13:28:52 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-kde-plasma-error-unknown-application-folder/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s apparently a foolish idea to login as root from a file manager on Plasma KDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was exactly what caused a number of problems, and among them, most notably, that I could not get past the login screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, little did it matter that I installed any of the other display managers available and removed the current in use from the command line. I was still unable to get past the login screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, it wasn’t just the usual &lt;code&gt;login failed&lt;/code&gt; which indicates the wrong username and/or password. This was exactly the opposite, as after inputting the password for the system, since &lt;code&gt;login automatically&lt;/code&gt; was disabled, the screen would fall back as if it loading the kernel again, and then without further ado, back into the login screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feedback loop process was endless. I couldn’t but scourge on Google for some sort of information regarding the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first queries to Google was with the terms &lt;strong&gt;plasma kde fails to startx&lt;/strong&gt;, although I knew that the last element of the query was not the most accurate. For one, because the &lt;strong&gt;X server&lt;/strong&gt; was somehow running, or else how could I have a login screen in the first place. But almost unsurprisingly, the first result from Google was from the Arch Linux forum entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=193286&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cannot start plasma 5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to follow one of the recommendations and modify the last line to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; exec startkde
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/change-xinitrc-for-kde-plasma-login.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but it made no difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps on other desktop environments the change on &lt;strong&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/strong&gt; was a success, but at least on Manjaro Plasma KDE, all of it was failing and I was not able to get past the login screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, the suggestion to modify the &lt;strong&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; desktop environment have proven to succeed without any major problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=147721&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Can’t get past the login screen&lt;/a&gt;, where modifying the &lt;code&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/code&gt; was more than enough to get it started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/change-xinitrc-for-xfce-login.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point it was futile to modify any further the &lt;strong&gt;.xinitrc&lt;/strong&gt; initialization file when moments before I had restarted the system, an error related to Plasma KDE had popped up on the screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/plasma-error-window.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple more errors from the main file manager Dolphin showed for example the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/user-xbel-kde-plasma.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/kio_applicationsrc-error.png&#34; width=&#34;500&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, after the infamous error with the &lt;strong&gt;kio_applicationsrc&lt;/strong&gt;, I very well knew that the culprit of it all occurred when trying to login as root to Plasma from the Dolphin file manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later on, after giving up the have Manjaro KDE running on the system, I found a few posts that spoke about logging in as root on the Plasma environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same post that for example was highlighted earlier, there is useful information as why running as root as KDE is altogether discouraged:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Errors During Hugo Git</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/errors-during-hugo-git/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 13 Dec 2017 15:56:07 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/errors-during-hugo-git/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;During the last setup of &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, I was faced again with the sometimes difficult handling of submodules. This was of course after the corresponding configuration for the &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;user.email&lt;/code&gt; had already been set accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next error which dealt with the git submodule was that it already existed in the index. Which made me look it up on Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the first results that came up after my query, was the following from the stackoverflow site at the StackExchange Network, entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12898278/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Issue with adding common code as git submodule: “already exists in the index”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer that has been widely accepted included as a solution having to invoke the &lt;code&gt;git rm --cached projectfolder&lt;/code&gt; on the tree of the folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After issuing it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm --cached .git/public 
 fatal: pathspec &#39;.git/public&#39; did not match any files
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which clearly led me nowhere, I noticed that further implementing correctly the command would require a few more steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command &lt;code&gt;git push origin master&lt;/code&gt; indicated that origin did not appear to be a git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git push origin master
 fatal: &#39;origin&#39; does not appear to be a git repository
 fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only after I invoked the &lt;code&gt;git rm -rf public&lt;/code&gt; which seemed to fix the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm -rf public/
 Migrating git directory of &#39;public&#39; from
 &#39;/public/.git&#39; to
 &#39;/.git/modules/public&#39;
 rm &#39;public&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seemed to at least tell me that the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder had been removed. So apparently the &lt;code&gt;--cached&lt;/code&gt; flag did nothing in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, by using the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;tab&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; key for autocompletion, right after the directories, I invoked &lt;code&gt;git rm -rf .git/modules&lt;/code&gt;, which showed the number of possibilities as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm -rf .git/modules/
 about                        index.html
 config.toml                  index.xml
 config.yaml                  js
 content                      page
 &#34;content                     post
 css                          &#34;post
 deploy.sh                    sitemap.xml
 .gitmodules                  static
 google4417fd3500b3c667.html  &#34;static
 images                       tags
 &#34;images                      themes
 img                          topics
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then again, I completed the &lt;code&gt;git rm -rf&lt;/code&gt; with the corresponding &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm -rf .git/modules/public/
 fatal: pathspec &#39;.git/modules/public/&#39; did not match any files
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which unfortunately again, came back with the &lt;strong&gt;fatal: pathspec&lt;/strong&gt; error from before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What worked, was to have the option &lt;code&gt;--cached&lt;/code&gt;, to be implemented right after &lt;code&gt;git rm&lt;/code&gt; only recursively with the &lt;strong&gt;.gitmodules&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm --cached .git
 .git/        .gitmodules  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which finally after tab completion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git rm --cached .gitmodules 
 rm &#39;.gitmodules&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it seems the &lt;code&gt;git rm --cached&lt;/code&gt; worked with the &lt;strong&gt;.gitmodules&lt;/strong&gt;, but it did not succeed with the &lt;strong&gt;.git/modules/public&lt;/strong&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was only after I invoked the Unix command &lt;code&gt;rm -rf&lt;/code&gt; under the &lt;strong&gt;.git&lt;/strong&gt; directory, that the problem was finally resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ rm -rf .git/modules/public/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it, the submodule was added again with the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; git submodule add -b master &amp;lt;name of static repository&amp;gt; public
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ git submodule add -b master https://github.com/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;static repository&amp;gt; public
 Cloning into &#39;/public&#39;...

 Resolving deltas: 100% (1247/1247), done.

 $ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The step-by-step instructions by simply issuing &lt;code&gt;rm -rf public&lt;/code&gt; as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tutorial to have Hugo running on Github&lt;/a&gt; suggested, did not work in this case, for the simple reason that the &lt;strong&gt;git repository&lt;/strong&gt; was cloned during the initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;.git/modules/public&lt;/strong&gt; already existed as a result. So it had to be removed by issuing &lt;strong&gt;rm -rf .git/modules/public&lt;/strong&gt; before setting up again the submodule remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Screen Locker Broken Manjaro Kde</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/screen-locker-broken-manjaro-kde/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 09 Dec 2017 13:58:20 EST</pubDate>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/screen-locker-broken-manjaro-kde/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;While updating a fresh installation of Manjaro KDE, the screen locked.
Apparently the default settings for the system, enabled this behavior without
further ado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this problem, the surprising part came afterward when the updates that were being downloaded, suddenly crashed the system. This led to the nonetheless bothersome problem of &lt;code&gt;modules.devname not found&lt;/code&gt; error followed by the no more troublesome error &lt;code&gt;you are now being dropped into an emergency shell&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sh can&#39;t access tty; job control turned off&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t have at the time a live media to access the system. Although I knew the that the sudden crashing during the download of updates , was one of the problems underlying the &lt;code&gt;modules.devname not found&lt;/code&gt; error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick google searched returned  &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/355689/manjaro-fails-to-boot-modules-devname-not-found-then-unknown-disk-uuid-error&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manjaro fails to boot, modules.devname not found&lt;/a&gt; a result which provided an answer that pointed to access the system with Manjaro’s own &lt;code&gt;mhwd-chroot&lt;/code&gt; command to access the emergency shell. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.manjaro.org/index.php/Restore_the_GRUB_Bootloader#Chroot_into_your_existing_Manjaro_Installation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chroot into your existing Manjaro Installation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/mhwd-chroot-steps.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as the already mentioned answer on the unix.stackexchange.com site suggested, it was necessary to reload the image again.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;!--# Configuring Kakoune Kakrc {#configuring-kakoune-kakrc .post-title}

[Dec 6, 2017]{.post-date}
--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Configuring the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune&#34;&gt;kakoune text editor&lt;/a&gt;
initialization file has been nothing short of a chore, as it requires
the path environment to be correctly set, before any changes on the
&lt;code&gt;kakrc&lt;/code&gt; take ahold of the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the tutorial suggests, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune#configuration-autoloading&#34;&gt;Configuration and
autoloading&lt;/a&gt;,
if it is launched with the &lt;code&gt;-n&lt;/code&gt; switch, kakoune will source the
&lt;code&gt;../share/kak/kakrc&lt;/code&gt;, but on a unrelated issue but nonetheless relevant
about the correct location for the initialization file, the developer
clearly stated that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kakrc file in share is Kakounes init script, it is not intended to
be user edited. It is actually that script that will load your user
configuration in ~/.config/kak/kakrc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/dont-use-share-kakrc.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1102&#34;&gt;clang completion
#1102&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, it is necessary to set the environment first on any Unix system.
The command &lt;code&gt;setenv&lt;/code&gt; is used for the &lt;strong&gt;csh&lt;/strong&gt; shell, whereas in &lt;strong&gt;bash&lt;/strong&gt;,
this is accomplished through the &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out whether for example, &lt;code&gt;XDG_CONFIG_HOME&lt;/code&gt; was set, is necessary
to invoke on the terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; printenv XDG_CONFIG_HOME
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which if it does not return a value, the environment has not been set
yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To set the environment across sessions, note it accordingly on your
&lt;code&gt;bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file with the &lt;code&gt;export&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;create a directory &lt;strong&gt;kak&lt;/strong&gt; under that environment, and further create
your init file &lt;strong&gt;kakrc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the available settings will be available without further
modifications. That is, some of the commands that are loaded by not
using a &lt;code&gt;kakrc&lt;/code&gt; file, will not have to be further tweaked with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; colorscheme &amp;lt;tab completion&amp;gt; &amp;lt;name of theme&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;can be identified without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, a handful of those that would have to be further
tweaked with, in order to load the &lt;strong&gt;kakrc&lt;/strong&gt; init file correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take for example, &lt;code&gt;autowrap-enable&lt;/code&gt;, which normally applies soft wrap
manipulation to the lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the developer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;autowrapping is provided by the autowrap.kak script (which should be
loaded by default), enable it for a buffer with the autowrap-enable
command, that you probably want to put in a hook (for example if you
want to always enable autowrap, add hook global WinCreate .* %{
autowrap-enable } in your kakrc. the autowrap_column option controls
the column on which to autowrap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/419&#34;&gt;Noob questions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/autowrap-kakrc.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further customizations to map certain keys are also necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, to map the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; backslash key to say the &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; semicolon.,
it&amp;rsquo;s imperative to precede the *&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; key with the &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; percent sign and
further enclose the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; backslash key within curly brackets &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;, so the
final code would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert %{\} &#39;;&#39; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of course, if the settings are desirable to be loaded globally, then&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map global insert %{\} &#39;;&#39;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;needs to be specified accordingly on the initialization file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See for example this issue: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/419&#34;&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t map to
backslash&lt;/a&gt;, which touched
upon the problem, and further linked
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1049&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1049&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1221&#34;&gt;https://github.com/mawww/kakoune/issues/1221&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s certainly two-fold that by specifying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert &#39;;&#39; \ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the behavior to have the &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; inserted, is easily accomplished, as shown
on the example above, but the same is not true, by having the same
characters inversed within the strings, that would yield the correct
results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for example whereas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert &#39;;&#39; \ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is correct, a simple &lt;code&gt;map buffer insert &#39;\&#39; ;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;throws an error with the message
&lt;code&gt;parse error: unterminated string &#39;...&#39;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s therefore necessary to have:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert %{;} \
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the same is true if one were to &lt;code&gt;map buffer insert &#39;\&#39; %{;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one of the methods that would work across buffers, is to have such
characters enclosed within curly brackets and further preceded by the
&lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert %{\} %{;} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; map buffer insert %{;} %{\} 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;For some unknown reason, I was getting the message &lt;code&gt;network has been disconnected&lt;/code&gt; even on connections that have been previously used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to the post entitled &lt;strong&gt;NetworkManager doesn’t automatically ask for a password for new network&lt;/strong&gt;, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=142066&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see this post on bbs.archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt; in my case the connection was used many times before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dependency problem that has plagued this bug seemed to make a comeback on a most of Manjaro desktop environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing, or better put, reinstalling it with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; yaourt -S gnome-keyring
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;seemed to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same problem hasn’t been experienced on Antergos distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mounting a Windows Hard Drive on Arch Linux</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/mounting-a-windows-hard-drive-on-arch-linux/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Nov 2017 13:40:27 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/mounting-a-windows-hard-drive-on-arch-linux/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After following some of the advice on &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NTFS-3G&#34;&gt;ntfs-3g arch linux&lt;/a&gt; entry which described the procedure to mount a windows system:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;lsblk -f&lt;/code&gt; call on the filesystem returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; sdb                                                         
 ├─sdb1 vfat   SYSTEM   
 ├─sdb2 ntfs   Recovery 
 ├─sdb3                 
 ├─sdb4 ntfs   OS       
 └─sdb5 ntfs   Restore  
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was after &lt;strong&gt;sdb4&lt;/strong&gt; in this case. So I invoked on the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ ntfs-3g /dev/sdb4 /mnt/fat/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which returned the message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; Unprivileged user can not mount NTFS block devices using the external FUSE
 library. Either mount the volume as root, or rebuild NTFS-3G with integrated
 FUSE support and make it setuid root. Please see more information at
 http://tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-faq/#unprivileged
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with sudo privileges I invoked it again, but this time around the more precise error message that &lt;em&gt;Input/output error NTFS is inconsistent&lt;/em&gt; was returned on the terminal. The entire message was as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error
 Failed to read of MFT, mft=391080 count=1 br=-1: Input/output error
 Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
 unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
 or fast restarting.)
 ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: Input/output error
 Failed to read NTFS $Bitmap: Input/output error
 NTFS is either inconsistent, or there is a hardware fault, or it&#39;s a
 SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows
 then reboot into Windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very
 important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate
 it
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I were to invoke it with &lt;code&gt;mount&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ntfs-3g&lt;/code&gt;, then it would have mounted it without a setback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdb4 /mnt/fat
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;successfully mounted it and I was able to access the files on that hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Git Committing by User Name Config</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/git-committing-by-user-name-config/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2017 13:01:35 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/git-committing-by-user-name-config/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had to set up again the local branches through git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An error that was not uncommon came up on the screen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; *** Please tell me who you are.

 Run

   git config --global user.email &#34;you@example.com&#34;
   git config --global user.name &#34;Your Name&#34;

 to set your account&#39;s default identity.
 Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time around it was done through configuring a &lt;code&gt;user.name&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;user.email&lt;/code&gt; on git itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It came to memory that the last time I was setting it up on a different system by pulling the sources from the remote branch, this configuration was never used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An answer on stackoverflow reminded me that this was indeed the case the last time I had done it. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/a/17713604&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; instead of doing a git pull you can do a git fetch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; git fetch
 git reset --hard origin/master
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the error from &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;please tell me who you are&lt;/strong&gt; comes up after an ssh key is granted, as it was posted on this other thread entitled &lt;em&gt;Git-please tell me who you are error when using ssh key&lt;/em&gt;, the best alternative is to specify the &lt;code&gt;--global&lt;/code&gt; option from &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; as it posted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/a/42335651&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; run git config –global user.email - git config –global user.name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if the option to have a &lt;code&gt;--global&lt;/code&gt; configuration is not desirable, then the removal of this &lt;code&gt;.gitconfig&lt;/code&gt; file may be accomplished through &lt;strong&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; again by issuing &lt;code&gt;git config --global --unset-all user.name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git config --global --unset-all user.email&lt;/code&gt; from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the website that aims at answering questions about the ubuntu distributiion, there are more examples with this purpose. See for example &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/206449/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; git config global file - remove settings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part about it lies on the command &lt;strong&gt;–unset-all&lt;/strong&gt;, even though the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com//a/282550&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;  answer&lt;/a&gt; which pointed at it was not the accepted solution in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details about the config-file for &lt;strong&gt;git&lt;/strong&gt; it is recommended to read the manual &lt;strong&gt;man git-config&lt;/strong&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Npm Warn Saveerror Enonent During Uninstall</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/npm-warn-saveerror-enonent-during-uninstall/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2017 13:44:21 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/npm-warn-saveerror-enonent-during-uninstall/</guid>
        <description> &lt;p&gt;I recently tried a few utility programs through &lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt; javascript manager. For further info see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Npm package manager&lt;/a&gt; on Wikipedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after trying them, I noticed that the output compilation was not what I had expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, or so it seems, that by default the programs end up on &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/node_modules&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept one of the programs which I found it handy and very convenient. But I just wanted to remove the rest from the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But lo and behold. The removal outcome for the programs was not what I had expected either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;npm&lt;/strong&gt; threw errors even with sudo privileges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; npm WARN enoent ENOENT: no such file or directory, open &#39;package.json&#39;
 npm WARN c No description
 npm WARN c No repository field.
 npm WARN c No README data
 npm WARN c No license field.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem was easily resolved by issuing the flag &lt;code&gt;-g&lt;/code&gt; (get) for a successful uninstall. So that was &lt;code&gt;npm uninstall &amp;lt;name&amp;gt; -g&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I checked on &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib/node_modules&lt;/code&gt;, to make sure the program was no longer on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manjaro Xfce Qpdfview Problem With Qt5ct Unable to Load Plugin in First Attempt</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-qpdfview-problem-with-qt5ct-unable-to-load-plugin-in-first-attempt/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 19 Oct 2017 03:52:43 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-qpdfview-problem-with-qt5ct-unable-to-load-plugin-in-first-attempt/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I currently have two (2) identical - or that’s what it seemed like - &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; environments on two (2) different hardware systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always keep at hand a list of viewers and if there is any problem removing those to be found unnecessarily large or extremely light to the point of rendering them useless, I tend to check the Arch Wiki at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/list_of_applications&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;List of Applications&lt;/a&gt; for a refresher on what’s available at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always found useful, more or less two (2), or three (3) of them, among them, with a quick copy-paste from the Arch Wiki:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gv — Graphical user interface for the Ghostscript interpreter that allows to view and navigate through PostScript and PDF documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ePDFView — Free lightweight PDF document viewer using the Poppler and GTK+ libraries. Development stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;qpdfview — Tabbed document viewer. It uses Poppler for PDF support, libspectre for PS support, DjVuLibre for DjVu support, CUPS for printing support and the Qt toolkit for its interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latter, strangely enough, was behaving differently on one of the &lt;strong&gt;manjaro xfce&lt;/strong&gt; systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick google search turned pretty much nothing, related to this issue I was having: namely, the adjustment and consequent resizing for the Settings Window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/manjaro-xfce-qpdfview-settings-box-wrong.png&#34; width=&#34;680px&#34; height=&#34;450px;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, I was unable to get to the bottom of the window whereto I could’ve specified &lt;strong&gt;to cancel&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;apply&lt;/strong&gt; the changes to take effect via a GUI. What use is a GUI if one can’t access the main settings of the program?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This took me to the wrong path in trying to modify the settings upon which the &lt;strong&gt;Dialog box&lt;/strong&gt; depended on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings for &lt;code&gt;qpdfview.conf&lt;/code&gt; were found right under the &lt;code&gt;.conf/qpdfview/&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To no avail I tried to change the settings for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; settingsDialogSize=@Size(488 803)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file, but every single time I did so, even after changing the above size to other feasible settings, the settings window loaded the default and preconfigured values for it, rendering any change I had made earlier such as modifying the values for that &lt;strong&gt;settingsDialogSize&lt;/strong&gt; onto the configuration file,  obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I gave up tweaking around with the &lt;code&gt;qpdfview.conf&lt;/code&gt; file. Even after removing this file, removing &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt; along with all poppler libraries from the system, reinstalling the program again, logging out of the system, and restarting, and logging right back in, the problem still persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settings window remained, remained useless for the most part - and from a GUI’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I could have just pressed the &lt;strong&gt;carriage&lt;/strong&gt; return key on the keyboard to apply the changes, or for that matter the &lt;strong&gt;escape&lt;/strong&gt; key to discard any changes, but this was just besides the point, since it defeated the purpose of having GUI applications running. I needed it to be operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried another venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that every single time that the program &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt; was invoked from the command line, several errors appeared, including the most significant of the lot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; qt5ct: using qt5ct plugin
 qt5ct: D-Bus global menu: no
 Could not load plug-in in first attempt: &#34;&#34;
 &#34;The shared library was not found.&#34;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the second of these messages was self-explanatory. The libraries upon which qpdfview relied upon, were not recognizing or finding the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search on google later regarding &lt;strong&gt;qt5ct&lt;/strong&gt; did not provide a satisfactory explanation behind the &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt; problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read some of the visual methods in adjusting the settings for &lt;strong&gt;qt&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pcsuggest.com/qt5ct-change-qt5-application-style/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Change Qt5 application style with qt5ct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I started &lt;strong&gt;qt5ct&lt;/strong&gt;, and I noticed that the default settings for the window was to have &lt;strong&gt;gtk2&lt;/strong&gt; as the style to be loaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then right after I had changed it to one of the other values, I had high expectations that the changes would improve the dimensions of the dialog box settings for &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt;. But I was wrong. It made everything worse off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally had to tweak around with the problem directly through the &lt;code&gt;qt5ct.conf&lt;/code&gt; file by changing the style field. Only then the problem with &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt; was resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=gtk2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The style value was modified to &lt;strong&gt;Breeze&lt;/strong&gt;, I saved the file and exited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;qt5ct.conf&lt;/strong&gt; file should have on the Appearance the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; [Appearance]
 color_scheme_path=
 custom_palette=true
 icon_theme=Vertex-Maia
 style=Breeze
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after making the changes - not even a logout was required - &lt;strong&gt;qpdfview&lt;/strong&gt; dialog box dimensions were working and definitely manageable. The only glitch - if it may be rightfully called as such - was an apparent back-to-back unwanted behavior in which the whole window for the settings, was not clearly visible, but one quick maximizing drag-around-movement maneuver, fixed the annoyance once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/qpdfview-correct-settings-dialog-box-1.png&#34; width=&#34;680&#34; height=&#34;450&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manjaro Xfce Bluetooth Problem</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 13:32:01 -0500</pubDate>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/</guid>
        <description> &lt;p&gt;Bluetooth recognition - at least on Manjaro Xfce - has been erratic and inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For no clear reason the LTS kernel and even a newer kernel have identified the hardware, while it has failed to do so in a great many occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the tweaks included reinstalling &lt;code&gt;bluez&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bluez-firmware&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bluez-libs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;bluez-tools&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;bluez-utils&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the drawing room and back again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bluetooth adapters were not being recognized however. And after logging out and back into the session, and even after &lt;code&gt;sudo /sbin/shutdown -r now&lt;/code&gt;, nothing seemed to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following day - to my surprise - I booted the system and it picked the bluetooth adapters without a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reminded me of a comment on the manjaro forum thread entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.manjaro.org/t/bluetooth-adapters-app-not-opening-bluetooth-manager-bluez-failed/4367/19&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bluetooth adapters app not opening Bluetooth Manager&lt;/a&gt; in which one of the participants said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth support in Linux is always troublesome, even in Windows, smartphone, etc. So yeah, I think staying away from bluetooth related hardwares if you want a trouble free experience. Wireless hardwares nowadays are going towards a dedicated receiver way to handle wireless connection and that’s a better approach. Just my two cents &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-xfce-bluetooth-problem/#blueref&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;blueref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to agree with him on that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the desktop environment &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; hasn’t - I ran it for a short while and perhaps my feedback is worthless of consideration on that regard - given me the same problems than the current configuration under &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I never thought that the problems would persist even after the installation of a newer kernel. That is perhaps the main reason which has been drifting me away from &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; until further notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;-fanboys have come up with the slogan that &lt;em&gt;it grows on you&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; is perhaps a more GNU/Linux-centric configurable environment than the former. I still enjoy tweaking with its features even though its less polished than Plasma &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. There is no question about this. &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; aims at the latest hardware, while &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on the rest. I’ve never tried to benchmark its memory and CPU consumption, but I’m almost certain it fairs much better than &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; will be a daily desktop environment driver running the main programs on which my workflow depends upon, it’s a question of time and how well it will handle them without a major setback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further oversights around Bluetooth vulnerabilities include technical papers such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.258.7253&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Security Risks in Bluetooth Devices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/8872/521819c79505ac20e5da8dd14f8c41eb3f07.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Bluetooth security threats and solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even recent articles from &lt;a
href=&#34;https://mobile.slashdot.org/story/17/09/12/2030213/blueborne-vulnerabilities-impact-over-5-billion-bluetooth-enabled-devices&#34;
target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Slashdot - BlueBorne Vulnerabilities Impact Over 5 Billion
Bluetooth-Enabled Devices&lt;/a&gt; have gone on at length about it. The following
paper - although unreliable since it looks more than a pamphlet from a company
that advertises its products under the pretension of providing unparalleled
protection - serves to confirm that regardless of its merit [this paper itsel]
is worth considering the possible risks could arise as a result from the
operations of bluetooth devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <description> &lt;p&gt;I haven’t read the &lt;code&gt;man&lt;/code&gt; pages enough to figure out some of the parameters that play an important behavior for the full functionality of the mighty &lt;strong&gt;urxvt&lt;/strong&gt;, and it was not until I read a post - which was more of a comment on the thread entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=221108&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;right click paste in urxvt terminal&lt;/a&gt; on the archlinux.org forum - when I realized that by the combination of &lt;strong&gt;ctrl&lt;/strong&gt; and right mouse click would copy and paste the selected text on the X window system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-08-18-ctrl-right-click-urxvt.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found the above to work without a problem under &lt;strong&gt;xclip&lt;/strong&gt; so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Urxvt Background Tweaking</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/urxvt-background-tweaking/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:05:19 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/urxvt-background-tweaking/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve never bothered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/rxvt-unicode&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;urxvt&lt;/a&gt; in the past. Perhaps was the way that dealt with the default glyph, which discouraged me from using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I found that the above was easily answered here at &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/81746/how-can-i-get-better-looking-fonts-in-my-term&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how can I get better looking fonts in my terminal (urxvt)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the simple fact that I had to modify it directly on &lt;code&gt;.Xresources&lt;/code&gt;, stopped me from doing all the necessary modifications to accomplish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I also found the excellent script &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/majutsushi/urxvt-font-size&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;urxvt-font-size&lt;/a&gt; which allows changing the font size on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one problem I faced with this magnificent terminal was the handling of the background color.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ignorant I was of the fact that although &lt;code&gt;.Xresources&lt;/code&gt; is the responsible source to change the background, one must specify it, and not expect to interpret the default values of &lt;code&gt;xterm&lt;/code&gt;, a different terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t until a post which was replying to a thread opened on the Arch\Linux forums entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=957150#p957150&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rxvt-unicode font color too dark&lt;/a&gt; which pretty much condensed what I was after, and made me feel more stupid afterward.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Setup Remote and Master Branches Before Updating Hugo</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/setup-remote-and-master-branches-before-updating-hugo/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2017 14:00:51 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/setup-remote-and-master-branches-before-updating-hugo/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago, I had to set remote and master branches on a different machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The methods included setting it up through the &lt;code&gt;git pull&lt;/code&gt; command. By going tis route, both the master and remote branches were consequently set and configured without a major inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, although I tried to replicate the same method above, I faced problems that included among many other errors, the infamous &lt;code&gt;error: src refspec master does not match any. error: failed to push some refs to &#39;origin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t going to go through the poor method of setting up a new site and copy-paste among other files, the &lt;code&gt;posts&lt;/code&gt; folder, the &lt;code&gt;theme&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;config&lt;/code&gt; files, and any other modification I had previously committed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site was being generated without a mishap, so I knew it had to do with the no less complicated &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, since some of the errors, like the above, were clearly describing that &lt;code&gt;origin&lt;/code&gt; did not match the one from the remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the necessary steps are as follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-Remove with &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; all leftovers from the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder with &lt;code&gt;git rm -rf public&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-Remove the &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; folder itself with &lt;code&gt;rm -rf.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-Add the static site as a submodule to the master with &lt;code&gt;git submodule add -b master &amp;lt;git@github.com:&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;USERNAME&amp;gt;.github.io.git public&amp;gt;.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that should be more than enough to have it working in no time. Push your changes and update it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Xfce Carpalx Layout</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/xfce-carpalx-layout/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2017 12:09:38 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/xfce-carpalx-layout/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many ways to add the &lt;a href=&#34;http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;carpalx&lt;/a&gt; layout to X window system on GNU/Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The desktop environment Plasma KDE does not have that problem. One could easily add it from the &lt;strong&gt;Input Devices&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;settings&lt;/strong&gt; of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If however, one is running &lt;strong&gt;Xfce&lt;/strong&gt;, things are not as straightforward as one would like them to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bottom of this post, one can find the zip archive where the &lt;em&gt;carpax.xkb&lt;/em&gt; file resides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unzip the contents and open up the README.txt to have an idea of what to copy. But there are two (2) things/caveats to remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One shouldn’t modify the &lt;em&gt;symbols/us&lt;/em&gt; file as it was suggested by the author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No need to follow Step 3 by loading the layout with setxkbmap carpalx. For one thing it will not load the default variant of the layout.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m just posting the following as it currently appears on the README.txt file provided by the author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;installation-instructions&#34;&gt;INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy carpalx.xkb to your XKB symbols directory (path my differ slightly)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ cp carpalx.xkb /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/carpalx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the following lines to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols.dir&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-dp—– a——- carpalx(qgmlwb)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qgmlwy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qfmlwy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qwkrfy)
–p—– a——- carpalx(qwyrfm)
–p—– a——- carpalx(tnwmlc)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it should be possible to load the layouts with, e.g.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ setxkbmap carpalx                            # defaults to QGMLWB
$ setxkbmap -layout carpalx -variant qwkrfy    # to select other variants&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following files should also be updated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.lst
/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules/xorg.xml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;one-better-way-to-accomplish-it&#34;&gt;One better way to accomplish it:&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;instructions-to-follow&#34;&gt;Instructions to follow&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Copy indeed carpalx.xkb to the XKB symbols directory with sudo privileges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ cp carpalx.xkb /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/carpalx&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;/usr/share/X11/xkb/rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$ cd /usr/share/X11/xkb/rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once there and with sudo privileges again open &lt;strong&gt;evdev.lst&lt;/strong&gt;. Add it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/edit-evdevlst.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the file &lt;strong&gt;edev.xml&lt;/strong&gt; and add the variant to the list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/edit-evdevxml.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;strong&gt;Keyboard Settings&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;xfce&lt;/strong&gt; graphical environment and add it. It will show on the list as shown in the following image:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downloadable zip files:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/distribution/carpalx-x11.zip&#34;&gt;http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/distribution/carpalx-x11.zip&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manjaro Announces Password Weakness en Los Instaladores De Dvd/usb</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-announces-password-weakness-en-los-instaladores-de-dvd_usb/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 13:20:54 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-announces-password-weakness-en-los-instaladores-de-dvd_usb/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recientemente en &lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/a&gt; se publicó el anuncio del lanzamiento de la última versión de &lt;a href=&#34;https://manjaro.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manjaro&lt;/a&gt; que incluye importantes actualizaciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-06-27-manjaro-announcement.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entre estas actualizaciones se encuentran las nuevas versiones de los instaladores gráficos tanto como &lt;strong&gt;thus&lt;/strong&gt; al igual que &lt;strong&gt;calamares&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También se anuncia la fragilidad en la generación de la contraseña o la clave que tanto el programa &lt;strong&gt;thus&lt;/strong&gt; como &lt;strong&gt;calamares&lt;/strong&gt; emplean durante el proceso de instalación a través tanto del ya mencionado &lt;strong&gt;thus&lt;/strong&gt; o de &lt;strong&gt;calamares&lt;/strong&gt; que en hashtag con modo predecible se utiliza durante la creación de estas contraseñas. &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-announces-password-weakness/#shadow&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;shadowref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las versiones más recientes de &lt;strong&gt;thus&lt;/strong&gt; y de &lt;strong&gt;calamares&lt;/strong&gt; no están afectadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por lo tanto es recomendable acceder al fichero que contiene estos errores y verificar si tu sistema está afectado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primero antes que todo para recordarnos quiénes somos - si por casualidad se nos olvidó el nombre de usuario, en la terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ whoami
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Que nos imprime el nombre de usuario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez con esta información y con privilegios de usuario, es decir, mediante &lt;code&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt;  accede al fichero &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; mediante tu editor de texto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desde la terminal selecciona uno de los siguientes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo emacs /etc/shadow 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; sudo vim /etc/shadow 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; SUDO_EDITOR=kate sudoedit /etc/shadow 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ingresa tu contraseña de usuario después para leer el fichero y verificar si la contraseña necesita ser regenerada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La penúltima línea del fichero comienza con tu nombre de usuario, es decir, con el valor que &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; devolvió anteriormente, seguido de &lt;code&gt;$6$&lt;/code&gt;, pero si la penúltima línea del fichero &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; contiene tu nombre de usuario encerrado por dos signos &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, entonces lo más probable es que necesitas crear nuevas contraseñas. Recuerda que tu nombre de usuario es el valor que &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; devolvió en la terminal. Este nombre de usuario no debe estar encerrado por los dos signos &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si necesitas corregir este error, y desde la terminal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ passwd 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cuyo comando invocará&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ Current password:
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Necesitas ingresar tu actual contraseña, y después especificar tu nueva contraseña, lo cual generará el hashtag correcto en el fichero &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antes de cerrar el archivo &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; que tenía estos errores, asegúrate que &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; no tiene los mismos problemas que el usuario. En este caso, &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt; es la primera línea del archivo &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; lo cual es más fácil de revisar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por ejemplo, si aparece:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; root: $6$ 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y después de ello aparece tu &lt;code&gt;whoami&lt;/code&gt; encerrado entre dos signos &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;, también tienes que arreglarlo con la generación de una &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; para &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para acceder &lt;strong&gt;root&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ sudo su
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;que por consiguiente estarás ejerciendo todos los comandos con los máximos privilegios desde la terminal. Si por casualidad no requiere la contraseña porque por ejemplo, haz accedido anteriormente con privilegios administrativos que utilizaste para cambiar la clave de usuario, asegúrate en ingresar en la línea de comando el ya mencionado:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; # passwd 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;el cual invocará que especifiques tu contraseña de root. Acto seguido a ello ingresa tu nueva contraseña.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el caso de &lt;strong&gt;shadow-&lt;/strong&gt; no hay que hacer ninguna modificación. Es decir, el fichero &lt;strong&gt;shadow-&lt;/strong&gt; que es seguido de un diptongo, es un archivo de copia del original.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gcc Multilib in Conflict With Gcc During Manjaro Upgrade</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gcc-multilib-in-conflict-with-gcc-during-manjaro-upgrade/</link>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gcc-multilib-in-conflict-with-gcc-during-manjaro-upgrade/</guid>
        <description>  &lt;p&gt;During the latest Manjaro upgrade, a conflict of packages already installed on the system, was preventing to proceed with the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search on Google returned among the results, a post which had recently been opened on the archlinux forum with the title &lt;a href=&#34;https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=226723&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;conflict with gcc-libs and gcc-libs-multilib&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the conflict of packages on my system, was not the same conflict than the ones reported on the archlinux forum such as with the package gcc-fortran, it was clear as a user suggested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;gcc-*-multilib is all or nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my system, querying the database for &lt;code&gt;gcc&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;pacman -Qs gcc&lt;/code&gt; returned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-06-08-gcc-gcc-multilib-conflict.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was missing &lt;strong&gt;gcc-libs&lt;/strong&gt;, while &lt;strong&gt;gcc-libs-multilib&lt;/strong&gt; was installed instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick &lt;code&gt;pacman -Ss gcc&lt;/code&gt; query - see &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/pacman#Querying_package_databases&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;archlinux wiki - Querying package databases&lt;/a&gt; would show the &lt;strong&gt;gcc-multilib&lt;/strong&gt; and its accompanying files for the package &lt;strong&gt;gcc-libs-multilib&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-06-08-gcc-multilib-gcc-libs-multilib.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I ended up doing to avoid the conflict and proceed with the upgrade as scheduled, was to remove the old version of &lt;strong&gt;gcc&lt;/strong&gt; - 6.8 if I’m not mistaken now, although I can always check the revision history for the exact number of the package I had at the time - and reinstall &lt;strong&gt;gcc&lt;/strong&gt;. I figured to do that, since for one, I had to install the newest version for the compiler anyways, and once done with the system upgrade, then the package &lt;strong&gt;gcc&lt;/strong&gt; would be reinstalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A final &lt;code&gt;pacman -Qs gcc&lt;/code&gt; would return:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-06-08-pacman-qs-gcc.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Gigabyte Computer Sleep Suspend Under Manjaro</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gigabyte-computer-sleep-suspend-under-manjaro/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2017 12:08:23 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gigabyte-computer-sleep-suspend-under-manjaro/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I had configured Manjaro under an old system and was never pressed with the issue of suspend on that old hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Gigabyte computer was finally up and running, I noticed that the system was unable to suspend or sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After failing to find a quick solution to the problem on the archlinux forums, I came across this post from the Manjaro site: &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.manjaro.org/t/manjaro-not-waking-from-suspend-or-sleep/492&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manjaro not waking from suspend or sleep&lt;/a&gt; and I almost knew  - not right away - that the discussion was the underlying cause of the problems I was experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the users, by the handle of &lt;em&gt;artoo&lt;/em&gt; offered to downgrade the kernel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-05-22-artoo-downgrade-suggestion.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kernel number and the year of the post were no longer relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But instead of the solution offered by the user &lt;strong&gt;artoo&lt;/strong&gt; in downgrading, I chose to upgrade instead, especially after the reply by another user who said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its likeley the problem with hooks in mkinitcpio.conf and users having to
manually mkinitcpio -p linux. Its a weekeley problem on irc and this fixes most
oftenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its very likely I assumed the initramfs get rebuild one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/2017-05-22-ivan-reply-mkinitcpiio.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the anecdote example almost a month later by another user in which he said that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time execution of mkinitcpio -p linux46 turns out to be sufficient&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>Firefox Problem With Xclip</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/firefox-problem-with-xclip/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 20 May 2017 13:58:18 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/firefox-problem-with-xclip/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve used both vim and neovim editors. The latter is just the newest implementation with out of the box pre-configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, whenever I was trying to use the copy paste command tool such as &lt;code&gt;xclip&lt;/code&gt;, both vim and neovim produced the newlines on the X window system across different applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when I set out to write an email on Gmail from Alphabet Inc., using a copy paste command tool such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/astrand/xclip&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;xclip&lt;/a&gt;, the process was to no avail: newlines were not being displayed on Gmail’s interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest match was a 2016 &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/4501&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Yanking to clipboard does not preserve newlines (when pasting to some applications&lt;/a&gt; issue that was opened but was eventually closed because the user decided to have &lt;code&gt;xsel&lt;/code&gt; take care of the problem for him/her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that post raised more questions than answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was a reference on that thread about seeing a post on
unix.stackexchange.com: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164074/pasting-in-thunderbird-turns-line-breaks-into-spaces&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;pasting-in-thunderbird-turns-line-breaks-into-spaces&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After reading the link provided, I recall having come across the same post hours earlier when I was trying to find out more about the issue. A Google search with keywords including but not limited to &lt;strong&gt;xclip&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;newlines&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;gmail&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;firefox&lt;/strong&gt; would return as one of the first results, that specific post which appeared on the stackexchange network before any other post and more relevant results would showed up. Perhaps even those that were more important queries on the web were relegated, but I guess that’s an entirely different issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer that was accepted on the stackexchange network for that particular question did nothing to resolve the problem, and I guess it wasn’t until I came across the outstanding bugs on Firefox as I will show later, that the buried comment by a user name Volker Siegel was more relevant than I thought:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. I indeed was using html. Turning this off solved the problem. What could
be an explanation for that? – user2820379 Apr 28 ‘15 at 8:18&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explanation? “Thunderbird, a software that has evolved over more than a decade
to follow changes in protocols and UI expectations. Under these circumstances,
it is inevitable that the structure degrades - know as bit rot. In this
context, it is hard to introduce a new feature in conflict with the current
state, when solving the conflict is infeasible. A new UI feature like HTML
editing may need to be sneaked in between rotten skeletons of old protocol
layers. It will work nicely, but as a result, you will find the configuration
of the new feature down between these old rotten sediments.” – Volker Siegel

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get at the reasoning behind this fiasco and whether to blame neovim or gmail for it.
On vim: pasting worked under the Gmail’s interface, whereas with neovim the process just failed: newlines turned into whitespace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bug is one of those outstanding and hence unresolved that for years has plagued the Firefox browser and its counterpart such as Firebird:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/firefox_bug_newlines.png&#34; alt=&#34;Paste in content editable div from xclip removes newlines&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1049785&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Paste in contentEditable div from xclip removes newlines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above post made a reference to &lt;a href=&#34;https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/gmail/aV8bdPFiR24/3Owwd9rSaD0J&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gmail ignoring newlines on Copy/Paste&lt;/a&gt; and the unhelpful answer of a user did nothing to pinpoint at the problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/gmail_ignoring_newlines_copypaste.png&#34; alt=&#34;gmail ignoring newlines&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ludicrous implementation of &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; before &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; is just nonsense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it also does not matter whether &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; was used instead or a simple &lt;code&gt;echo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ echo -e &#39;una prueba\npara ver&#39; | xclip -sel c 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ echo $&#39;una prueba\npara ver&#39; | xclip -sel c 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;xsel&lt;/code&gt; the flags are entirely different. But this clearly showed that Firefox is still trying to catch up with it. Gmail is not the problem. If it were I’d be more than happy to denote it. One could verify it by using a different email service such as Outlook from Microsoft for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search related to Firefox turned out many more issues than what was originally intended, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1174452&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Copying text with the style “white-space: pre;” does not preserve white space (spaces, tabs, newlines)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the above thread, an &lt;a href=&#34;https://bug1174452.bmoattachments.org/attachment.cgi?id=8646518&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;attachment&lt;/a&gt; provided can also be verified with &lt;code&gt;xclip&lt;/code&gt;. It does not work under Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;a href=&#34;https://kb.iu.edu/d/bdkf&#34;&gt;bug 116083&lt;/a&gt; is still on the database for the Indiana University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;References&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Libreoffice Implementación Del Guión en La Separación Silábica</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/libreoffice-implementaci%C3%B3n-del-gui%C3%B3n-en-la-separaci%C3%B3n-sil%C3%A1bica/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 02:29:35 -0500</pubDate>

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/libreoffice-implementaci%C3%B3n-del-gui%C3%B3n-en-la-separaci%C3%B3n-sil%C3%A1bica/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Para implementar la separación silábica en cualquier documento en Libreoffice, es necesario bajar los correspondientes archivos de extensiones para este programa: &lt;a href=&#34;https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/spanish-dictionaries/0.6&#34;&gt;https://extensions.libreoffice.org/extensions/spanish-dictionaries/0.6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-download-dictionaries.png&#34; alt=&#34;Diccionario en español con separación silábica y corrector ortográfico&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez descargado y guardado este archivo, se utiliza el mismo programa Libreoffice para cargarlo posteriormente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después se selecciona bajo el menú de &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt;, y &lt;strong&gt;options&lt;/strong&gt; como se muestra:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-tools-options-menu.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;que por consiguiente inicia la ventana correspondiente que especifica el recién bajado diccionario y como muestra la siguiente figura:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-language-settings.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muy importante en darle clic a &lt;strong&gt;OK&lt;/strong&gt; a esta ventana donde el diccionario haya sido seleccionado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después de esto, y para que el corrector ortográfico aplique al actual documento, es necesario en asegurarnos que el idioma sea seleccionado desde el menú de &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; seguido de &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt;, y después como opción si el corrector ortográfico se aplicaría a todo el texto del documento, o a solamente un párrafo, y hasta una determinada selección, y como se muestra en la siguiente imagen:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-language-selection.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el caso del guión de separación silábica sería necesario en darle clic nuevamente al menú de &lt;strong&gt;tools&lt;/strong&gt; (herramientas) seguido de &lt;strong&gt;language&lt;/strong&gt; para que la opción &lt;strong&gt;hyphenation&lt;/strong&gt; tome vigencia y aplique al texto del documento:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-hyphenation-menu-clic.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo que sucede con el paso anterior, que sencillamente no es lo más práctico. Y lo mismo se puede comprobar si en cada modificación o mejor dicho, en cada terminación de línea o párrafo u oración se tuviese que emplear lo antedicho para que el ingreso automático de guión ocurra a través de todo el texto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para lograr esto, es decir, en emplear en ese caso un ingreso automático del guión silábico, es necesario en ir al menú de &lt;strong&gt;Styles&lt;/strong&gt; seguido de &lt;strong&gt;Styles and Formatting&lt;/strong&gt; del documento como tal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-styles-formatting-menu.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O si te es más fácil dándole clic a &lt;strong&gt;Edit Style&lt;/strong&gt; del actual documento:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-styles-edit-style.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El cual abrirá otra ventana que manipula los valores para la pre-configuración del estilo del documento. Asegúrate que selecciones &lt;strong&gt;Text Flow&lt;/strong&gt; el cual especifica si la &lt;strong&gt;hyphenation&lt;/strong&gt; o la separación silábica ocurriría automáticamente:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/libreoffice-automatic-hyphenation.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que esta opción sea seleccionada, dale a clic para que los cambios apliquen al documento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siempre es aconsejable consultar muchas de las oficiales referencias acerca de este programa en &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.libreoffice.org/&#34;&gt;https://help.libreoffice.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referencia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/gigabyte-motherboard-fails-to-load-live-cd-but-succeeds-with-flash-drive/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I can’t say whether some of the systems that NUC Intel produces, face the same problems while loading a LiveCD/LiveDVD iso image via an external drive, as the manufacturer Gigabyte currently does. The latter manufacturer gave me the proverbial run for the money when I wanted to install an image that was burned on a DVD and had been successfully installed on an old system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only I tried to load two (2) different images that proved to have been installed without issues and worked correctly on two (2) separate old Dell systems, but it seemed that even after specifying the external DVD/Writer on the first prioritized boot order of the BIOS, the motherboard was simply unable to identify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can’t attest whether the BIOS for that particular model is used across similar boards, although is unlikely, but what I can guarantee is that after several attempts, including and not limited to one instance, in which the board seemed to boot in the desired order, in the end was a total disaster: even a warning came up - something that had to do with a missing file from the installation burned DVD image- which appeared on the screen, and would not let me continue.&lt;br&gt;
I wondered at that point whether the motherboard BIOS was clearly identifying the external DVD writer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search on Google confirmed it. The motherboard would identify the external DVD only sparingly and inconsistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had an HDD preloaded with an operating system. And had no problems whatsoever to load it directly. But connecting an HDD with a preloaded OS would miss the point altogether. How about if the HDD had no OS preconfigured on it. Then it would become a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Google search returned different scenarios which were not applicable to my situation.
One user pointed out that by disconnecting and connecting the external DVD right after powering on the motherboard resolved his issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone on the Anandtech forums - I remember this website from years before, it published some if not the best reviews about SDDs on the marked - briefly spoke about it. This time around someone on the forum, a subdomain of Anandtech, responded that one reason he/she likes to read the posts is too help him/her determine what motherboard &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to buy. Another user rightfully expressed his dissatisfaction with this particular brand’s issue on modern times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post on a blog from blogspot pointed out that the solution in his/her case was to tweak with the USB connection. Other responses that followed had to do with the failure on the users’ part, in properly identifying the boot order for the device. But this was not the problem I was having. If anything, I noticed - like I wrote earlier - the inconsistency of the board’s BIOS in simply recognizing the connection. Whereas sometimes it would show right after powering the system, other times it would not show up at all. &lt;a href=&#34;#blogspot&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;blogref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disabling &lt;strong&gt;AHCI&lt;/strong&gt; mode in favor of &lt;strong&gt;Legacy&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;IDE&lt;/strong&gt; like a user pointed out on Anandtech did not resolve it either. And much less by changing the preloaded configuration for &lt;strong&gt;CSM&lt;/strong&gt;. At one point, the system could not even access the BIOS at all, and it became unresponsive. Only after unplugging the cable from the external DVD writer, the BIOS utility would actually show up. This last inconsistent behavior I noticed it by messing with different settings like the ones I mentioned earlier, in which I was faced with the same problem. The only way to access the BIOS was by unplugging the cable. &lt;a href=&#34;#anand&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;anandref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to that point I stopped looking and reading for viable solutions altogether. Nothing I tried seemed to work, even though I could plug in an HDD with a preloaded OS. The GB-BXBT run fine or without major problems on a preloaded OS, and yet I was unable to load a live CD/DVD and install it from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed that the problem with the USB for the BIOS settings for example, was supposedly patched years ago. And the latest updates for the BIOS on that particular system occurred a year or two before the manufacturer shipped the system to resellers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the external DVD writer would appear and disappear at times while turning on the motherboard was simply beyond me. I was unable to confirm nonetheless the same findings than the user at blogspot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment I realized I could no longer waste any more time in trying to install the Live CD/DVD from the DVD writer onto the HDD. Luckily I had an old USB drive lying around that I could use for testing purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For years I had installed from Live CD/DVDs onto the majority of the systems. It seemed, this was no longer possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to use the simplest method to have a portable OS on a flash drive that could - hopefully install onto the HDD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Arch Wiki &lt;a href=&#34;#dd&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;ddref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the command line could come handy for this purpose:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdx status=progress &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sync
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took a few minutes for the process to finish but in the end I could no longer complain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had to press the &lt;code&gt;DEL&lt;/code&gt; key one more time to access the BIOS. Then just like before, went to specify the boot order that the board should recognize first. The boot sequence showed the HDD on the first spot, followed by the flash drive I had recently copied the image to. Rebooted the system and finally the Manjaro installer loaded without an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The installation finished without problems. Later I removed the flash drive. Rebooted the system without having to go into the BIOS again., and successfully the fresh installation of Manjaro with the XFCE environment was running updates as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Manjaro Desplaza a Ubuntu</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-desplaza-a-ubuntu/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 14 Mar 2017 13:23:51 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-desplaza-a-ubuntu/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hace más o menos un mes que escribí acerca de la configuración del &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/manjaro-splash-screen-in-ssd/&#34;&gt;tema splash de la pantalla&lt;/a&gt; y el cual se podía anular en la susodicha configuración a través de las &lt;strong&gt;preferencias&lt;/strong&gt;,  seguido del &lt;strong&gt;tema del escritorio&lt;/strong&gt; cuando se utiliza un disco de estado sólido o un SSD (solid state drive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el momento de escribir acerca de ello, y de acuerdo a las estadísticas que se mostraban en &lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;distrowatch.com&lt;/a&gt;, los datos que se habían recopilado no reflejaban aún los últimos seis meses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No obstante a ello, es sorprendente que por primera vez en la historia de los sistemas GNU/Linux, una distribución basada en &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinux.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;  haya dejado rezagadas a distribuciones tales como Opensuse, y más sorprendente aún a Ubuntu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/gnulinux_ranking_2017.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ranking in the last 6 months&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;¿Cuáles han sido (entre varias causas) los más significantes problemas que sistemas tales como Ubuntu han experimentado?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He leído desde hace tiempo la insatisfacción de los usuarios cuando se refiere a la decisión que tomó Canonical en implementar Amazon en el entorno de escritorio Unity. A punto tal que si no hubiese sido por la presión ejercida por muchos de sus usuarios y hasta un artículo de Stallman quien profundizó más acerca de esto en un artículo titulado &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/ubuntu-spyware.en.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Ubuntu Spyware: What to do?&lt;/a&gt; donde criticó a este proyecto, el código que Canonical empleó desde el entorno gráfico del gestor de archivos, se continuaría lanzando en cada versión futura.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aparentemente, en la versión 16.04 de LTS (Long Term Support) de Ubuntu, esta función no estaría activada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pero no creo tampoco que estos han sido los problemas más fundamentales que esta distribución experimentó. Los problemas más agudos han sido las propias experimentaciones que los desarrolladores han llevado a cabo con las actualizaciones, las que han causado graves interrupciones que como consecuencia han resultado en sistemas operativos GNU/Linux inservibles e inoperables en muchos de los casos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fui uno de los usuarios, que por ejemplo, experimentó que de buenas a primeras el network-manager crashed. Cuando quise averiguar más tarde, si alguien más estaba atravesando por ello, una búsqueda rápida en Google me redirigió a &lt;a href=&#34;https://askubuntu.com/questions/727127/last-upgrade-crashes-network-manager-no-internet-connection-no-applet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt; Last upgrade crashes network manager (no internet connection, no applet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este suceso ejemplifica la descentralización de una distribución cuando toma decisiones reprochables e injustificables. También ejemplifica la irremediable desvinculación de los programadores con una de las distribuciones más user-friendly de todos los tiempos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recuerdo haber leído a Eric Raymond cuando habla sobre este fenómeno en la edificación de una catedral en comparación con un bazar. Considero que fue el primero de estos que el limitado grupo de programadores en Canonical llevó a cabo, en vez de tener en cuenta al usuario, o las acciones que perjudicarían a estos, como medio para el fin y no como un fin por sí solo o para simplemente satisfacer un objetivo sin evaluar profundamente las consecuencias resultantes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si aprenden o no la lección eso pasa a la historia.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Configurar El Idioma en Manjaro Kde</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/configurar-el-idioma-en-manjaro-kde/</link>
        <pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2017 12:44:42 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/configurar-el-idioma-en-manjaro-kde/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Para modificar el idioma que los elementos del menú muestren, al igual que el idioma con el que aparecería la hora, la fecha, y otros valores como los de la representación monetaria, se puede ir hasta las &lt;strong&gt;preferencias del sistema&lt;/strong&gt; y después dándole a clic a &lt;strong&gt;Configuración regional&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/modify-regional-language-spanish-manjaro-kde.png&#34; alt=&#34;regional-language-spanish&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La ventana siguiente que lleva de título &lt;strong&gt;añadir y configurar la configuración regional&lt;/strong&gt;, muestra las configuraciones regionales del sistema que  te permite (a mano derecha) añadir el otro idioma que deseas, a la pre-configurada lista de las regiones en el sistema. Debes notar también que una vez que esto sea especificado, el sistema requiere recomenzar para que los cambios se carguen adecuadamente en el sistema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/modify-regional-language-spanish-manjaro-kde-add.png&#34; alt=&#34;regional-language-manjaro-add&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por supuesto que es posible lograr esto mediante el intérprete de comandos a través de &lt;code&gt;localect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;según se muestra reflejado en &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wiki.archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es decir,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; localectl set-locale LANG=es_US.UTF 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para ver la lista de los locales en tu sistema, puedes emplear en este caso el siguiente comando:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; localectl list-locales 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y de ahí seleccionaer el idioma regional que quisieras utilizar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;una vez logrado este paso, es necesario ingresar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;localectl set-locale LANG=es_US.UTF-8 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;o el idioma de tu preferencia. Pongo ese solamente como un ejemplo donde se vea ente procedimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es bueno recalcar y como lo explica el sitio en &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/locale#Setting_the_system_locale&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;wiki.archlinux.org&lt;/a&gt; que el fichero &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.gen&lt;/code&gt; muestra aquellas variables que se encuentran señaladas y que posteriormente serían cargadas en el fichero del sistema &lt;code&gt;/etc/locale.conf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para más información acerca de esto vea la sección &lt;strong&gt;Setting the system locale&lt;/strong&gt; en la wiki.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Referencias&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Pantalla en Reposo Con Manjaro KDE</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pantalla-en-reposo-con-manjaro-kde/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 24 Feb 2017 13:45:58 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/pantalla-en-reposo-con-manjaro-kde/</guid>
        <description> &lt;p&gt;Cada vez que se trabaja con algún entorno gráfico en los sistemas GNU/Linux, como GNOME, xfce, MATE, al igual que en KDE, uno se pone al amparo de los desarrolladores de estos sistemas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digo al amparo, porque uno tiene que estar a esperas de lo que estos programadores decidan sobre las configuraciones idóneas del sistema. Y muchas veces, como es de esperar y se ha comprobado a través del tiempo, no han sido las más eficientes decisiones, desde el punto de vista del usuario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si se le pregunta al usuario cuáles serían las mejores maneras para tener acceso a estos servicios gráficos, muchos quizás darían diferentes opiniones. Unos dirían que el lugar en el menú para especificas estas opciones, se encontraría en las &lt;strong&gt;preferencias del sistema&lt;/strong&gt; por ejemplo, mientras que otros posiblemente opinarían que aunque estarían de acuerdo en ello, lo conveniente es resumirlo dentro de la &lt;strong&gt;gestión de energía&lt;/strong&gt; (administración del consumo de energía).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En mi caso, fue la última de estas opciones en las que pensé que cualquier cambio de las configuraciones tomarían lugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pero lo mismo da, en estos casos, porque cuando se han implementado ciertas funciones, la opinión de los usuarios, a no ser aquellas que en esos casos donde por petición popular de la mayoría, logren en acordar y convencer a los desarrolladores en implementarlas, casi siempre no suscitan el interés que otras funciones conllevan. Y por lo tanto estas otras opciones gráficas dejan de ser modificadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También hay que tener en cuenta que muchos otros usuarios hispano-parlantes, (o debería decir la gran mayoría), se adaptan a estas condiciones, incluso en aquellos casos donde estas funciones interceden en el uso diario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este es el caso de algo tan sencillo como el &lt;em&gt;reposo automático de la pantalla&lt;/em&gt; que se experimenta en Manjaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por norma, el tiempo que transcurre antes que el sistema cierra la sesión, o por lo menos en Manjaro KDE, es de unos cinco minutos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pensé en realizar el cambio desde un principio a través de la ya mencionada &lt;strong&gt;administración del consumo de energía&lt;/strong&gt; o la &lt;strong&gt;gestión de energía&lt;/strong&gt;, pero esta función del sistema no tiene nada que ver con ello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Este reposo de la pantalla, se controla desde &lt;strong&gt;Bloqueo de pantalla&lt;/strong&gt; o &lt;strong&gt;Screen locking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primero antes que todo, y desde la ventana principal de las &lt;strong&gt;Preferencias del sistema&lt;/strong&gt;, se le da clic al ya mencionado &lt;strong&gt;Comportamiento del escritorio&lt;/strong&gt; (que aparece bajo &lt;strong&gt;Espacio de trabajo&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/comportamiento-del-escritorio-manjaro.png&#34; alt=&#34;comportamiento-del-escritorio&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acto seguido a ello y a mano izquierda, se le da clic a &lt;strong&gt;Bloqueo de pantalla&lt;/strong&gt;, que una vez abre a mano derecha las opciones de configuración bajo el título de &lt;strong&gt;Tiempos de espera del bloqueo de pantalla&lt;/strong&gt; y como se muestra en la siguiente imagen que muestra el tabulador de activación, el período de tiempo en minutos que se necesita modificar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El valor pre-configurado son de unos 5 minutos. Se puede especificar el tiempo que uno estime apropiado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/bloqueo-de-pantalla-screen-locking-manjaro.png&#34; alt=&#34;bloqueo-de-pantalla-en-manjaro&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Turn Off Manjaro Kde Splash Screen if on Ssd</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/turn-off-manjaro-kde-splash-screen-if-on-ssd/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 15 Feb 2017 04:02:19 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/turn-off-manjaro-kde-splash-screen-if-on-ssd/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Posicionado desde hace meses en el quinto escalafón de la lista de las distribuciones basadas en &lt;a href=&#34;http://distrowatch.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, la distribución &lt;a href=&#34;https://manjaro.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Manjaro &lt;/a&gt;, basada en la impresionante distribución &lt;a href=&#34;http://archlinux.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/a&gt;, y que hace uso del magnífico sistema de administración de paquetes &lt;strong&gt;Pacman&lt;/strong&gt; de este último, emplea los últimos e innovadores temas de interfaz gráficos en muchas de las ediciones, tanto de la comunidad, como aquellas que son aprobadas oficialmente. &lt;a href=&#34;#man&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;manref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No tuve problema alguno con la instalación del sistema operativo. Todo parecía funcionar sin problemas. La tarjeta gráfica del ordenador se había identificado apropiadamente durante el proceso de instalación, al igual que la tarjeta inalámbrica que permite el acceso al Internet para la continuación de cualquier actualización que se necesitaría llevar a cabo más tarde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El mayor problema recaía en el tiempo que tomaba antes que el escritorio gráfico de este sistema operativo estuviera disponible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después de reinicializar las sesiones en varias ocasiones, me di cuenta que este lapso que estaba experimentando, no era algo necesariamente deseable, y peor aún, porque muchas veces fallaba por completo en cargar el entorno gráfico KDE, mientras que el resto del sistema estaba simplemente congelado. Esto imposibilitaba por ende, el acceso a la línea de intérprete de comandos, al igual que a cualquier operación de revisión de errores. Bajo estas condiciones, el sistema entero se paralizaba y por consiguiente era algo inaceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aunque el origen de este problema no era tan sencillo de rastrear, me di cuenta que ‘startx’ podía ser el causante. Una búsqueda rápida en Google dio como resultados en su primer hit de búsqueda a una pregunta similar titulada: &lt;em&gt;Plasma desktop 5 boots very slowly&lt;/em&gt; que había sido hecha en el boletín de Arch Linux.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La pregunta del op era la siguiente:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is there any way to debug Plasma-desktop 5 loading process to figure out why it is slow?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a lo que una respuesta continuaba después que decía:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if on ssd, it’s better to turn off splash screen. &lt;a href=&#34;#ssd&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;ssdref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y eso era exactamente lo que estaba ocurriendo, o por lo menos en mi caso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después de ello y una vez en el menú gráfico del sistema, se selecciona las configuraciones del sistema o &lt;em&gt;settings&lt;/em&gt; . Una vez allí y bajo el tabulador &lt;em&gt;Appearance&lt;/em&gt; se selecciona &lt;em&gt;Workspace Theme&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/manjaro-workspace.png&#34; alt=&#34;manjaro-workspace&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/tema-del-espacio-de-trabajo.png&#34; alt=&#34;manjaro-espacio-de-trabajo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que se seleccione el &lt;em&gt;Tema&lt;/em&gt; y como se mostrará en la siguiente figura, se debe especificar que &lt;em&gt;None&lt;/em&gt; o &lt;em&gt;ninguno&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/manjaro-splash.png&#34; alt=&#34;manjaro-splash&#34;&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/no-splash-en-manjaro-kde.png&#34; alt=&#34;manjaro-no-splash&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&#34;man&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Lanzamientos oficiales de Manjaro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#manref&#34;&gt;&amp;crarr;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>Reemplazo De Minúsculas Con Mayúsculas Con Emacs</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazo-de-min%C3%BAsculas-con-may%C3%BAsculas-con-emacs/</link>
        <pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 02:31:55 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazo-de-min%C3%BAsculas-con-may%C3%BAsculas-con-emacs/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Para un simple reemplazo de caracteres al principio de una oración, es decir, de minúsculas por mayúsculas, se puede emplear un simple y eficiente método de expresión regular también en Emacs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ya existe un modo de &lt;em&gt;capitalization&lt;/em&gt; que logra este reemplazo de una cadena de caracteres o cadena de texto como se dice en inglés: string, y aunque tiene un inigualable mérito para este propósito, de igual manera retrasa el ingreso de caracteres., como es de esperar, el retraso o el lapso que esto conlleva, es una desventaja para una óptima funcionalidad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digamos por ejemplo que:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;foo bar. foo bar. foo bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para modificar la minúscula por una mayúscula:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; M-x replace-regex
 \(\. \w\)
 \,(capitalize \1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;que nos da como resultado:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;foo bar. Foo bar. Foo bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pero el comienzo de la oración o de la línea no se ha modificado, entonces:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; M-x replace-regex
 \(^\w\)
 \,(capitalize \1)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;logra hacer la modificación restante a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foo bar. Foo bar. Foo bar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si deseas hacer la modificación de una vez y por todas, y abreviando por consiguiente las dos expresiones regulares anteriores, utilizarías en este caso el delimitador &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; antes de la barra oblicua &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;. Es decir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; M-x replace-regex
 \(^\w\|\. \w\)
 \,(capitalize \1) 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reemplaza el original foo bar. foo bar. foo bar. A Foo bar. Foo bar. Foo bar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si por aluna casualidad, Emacs no reconoce y te devuelve como resultado que reemplazó (0) eventos, quizás pudiese tuvieses que palanquear (toggle) &lt;code&gt;case-replace&lt;/code&gt; a nulo (nil).

        <title>Reemplazar Con Vim. Reemplazos de minúsculas con mayúsculas</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazar-con-vim/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2017 13:48:53 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazar-con-vim/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;O como se dice en Inglés: &lt;em&gt;capitalization&lt;/em&gt;, se puede lograr fácilmente en &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;vim &lt;/a&gt; mediante el empleo de mayúsculas al comienzo de oraciones a través del uso de una expresión regular o regex, sin la necesidad de utilizar algún que otro script (que puede causar efectos secundarios en el funcionamiento), para lograr el reemplazo de las minúsculas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el website de programadores de superuser.com, &lt;a href=&#34;http://superuser.com/questions/737130/automatically-capitalize-the-first-letter-of-sentence-in-vim&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;superuser.com/questions/737130/automatically-capitalize-the-first-letter-of-sentence-in-vim&lt;/a&gt; se hace esta misma pregunta para lograr el reemplazo automático de minúsculas por mayúsculas al principio de cada oración.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una de las repuestas &lt;a href=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazo-de-minusculas-por-mayuscula-en-oracion/#script&#34;&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; hace énfasis de esto mediante la adición de un unas líneas de script o programa de ejecución.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El problema que esto conlleva, y como uno de los usuarios comentó,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only problem is this script seems to add a noticeable lag when typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es que mientras más extenso sea el documento, más se experimenta el lag o el retraso en el ingreso de caracteres. Es decir, la óptima funcionalidad se pierde parcialmente. Solo es necesario en tener un documento que comprenda un número de ciento y algo líneas, (y esto es sin contar que haya encima de ello algunas que otras líneas de código), para notar la diferencia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considero que sin tanta complicación que más tarde nos puede afectar, la mínima utilización de un reemplazo de caracteres mediante una expresión regular, tuviese mejores resultados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para cambiar la minúscula por mayúscula sería necesario entonces algo como:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ :%s/\.[a-z]/\U&amp;amp;/g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e. g.,  si el espacio después de la puntuación fue ingresado, no se te olvide cambiar el código encima con el espacio sobrante correspondiente, tal como&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ :%s/\. [a-z]/\U&amp;amp;/g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y para lograr el intercambio al comienzo de cada línea, entonces&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ :%s/^[a-z]/\U&amp;amp;/g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;reemplaza la minúscula desde el comienzo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para reemplazar múltiples patrones de búsqueda, se debe emplear el sufijo &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; después de la expresión regular con la que se modificaría la búsqueda,  separado de una barra vertical &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; que separe los dos grupos, es decir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ :%s/^[a-z]/\U&amp;amp;/ge | %s/\. [a-z]/\U&amp;amp;/ge
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otras de las maneras de emplear esta &lt;em&gt;expresión regular&lt;/em&gt; es mediante la substitución de &lt;code&gt;[a-z]&lt;/code&gt; por &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt;. una búsqueda rápida en &lt;code&gt;:help&lt;/code&gt; nos indica que &lt;code&gt;\w&lt;/code&gt; equivale a &lt;code&gt;[0-9A-Za-z]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;por lo tanto se pudiese emplear algo tal como&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $ :%s/^\w/\U&amp;amp;/ge | %s/\. \w/\U&amp;amp;/ge 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Footnotes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;a name=&#34;script&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;Respuesta de usuario de vim para el empleo de un script que reemplace minúscula por mayúscula pero que causa lag en documentos &lt;a href=&#34;http://superuser.com/a/737155&#34;&gt;http://superuser.com/a/737155&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Modificar Mapa Del Teclado Con Emacs Y Vim</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/modificar-mapa-del-teclado-con-emacs-y-vim/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:40:45 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/modificar-mapa-del-teclado-con-emacs-y-vim/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Estos son algunos de los ejemplos que se pueden utilizar a través de los inmensamente populares editores de programación Emacs &lt;a href=&#34;#emacs&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; y Vim &lt;a href=&#34;#vim&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, para cambiar el mapa del teclado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;emacs&#34;&gt;Emacs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El altamente configurable y extensible editor de texto Emacs también nos puede ayudar con modificaciones del teclado, o cambiar la localización de las teclas, sin la necesidad de cambiar todo el diseño, y sin la necesidad de tener que utilizar algún teclado en específico.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primero se crea una función que se le asigna un nombre determinado. En este caso utilizamos el nombre de “backslash”. Posteriormente a esto, se le atribuye el comando &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; seguido de &lt;code&gt;kbd&lt;/code&gt; y el mapa del registro del teclado que se desea modificar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En mi caso, encontré conveniente intercambiar las teclas &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; por &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; y viceversa. Por ejemplo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(defun backslash ()
  (interactive)
  (insert (kbd &#34;\\&#34;)))

(global-set-key (kbd &#34;; &#34; ) &#39;backslash)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;al igual que:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(defun semicolon ()
  (interactive)
  (insert (kbd &#34;;&#34; )))

(global-set-key (kbd &#34;\\&#34; ) &#39;semicolon)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Como se puede ver en los ejemplos anteriores, después de esto se le asigna &lt;code&gt;global-set-key&lt;/code&gt; a la recién nombrada función. Es decir, en el primer caso, la función se le asignó el nombre &lt;code&gt;backslash&lt;/code&gt;, y la cual fue directamente entrelazada con el ya mencionado comando &lt;code&gt;global-set-key&lt;/code&gt; seguido de la tecla &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De esta manera se logra el objetivo deseado. Esto es, que el ingreso de una tecla dada en el mapa del teclado del registro de entrada del sistema operativo, sea interpretado  posteriormente, - mediante la nueva asignación que proveyó la función - con el registro del mapa de otra tecla que haya sido predeterminada, dando lugar con ello a que ese ingreso del mapa del teclado, se registre apropiadamente con los resultados de la salida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el primer ejemplo, cada vez que la tecla &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;sea presionada, la tecla &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; tomará precedencia. Y viceversa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vim&#34;&gt;Vim&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;en el caso de Vim, el editor de texto más utilizado en Unix, y el cual está disponible de fábrica, o en la mayoría de las variaciones de Unix, el modificar el mapa del teclado se obtiene de varias maneras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solamente mostraré el comando que lograría esto de la manera más simple y durante el modo de insertar: &lt;code&gt;inoremap&lt;/code&gt;, el cual es seguido de la tecla que se desea modificar, con la que tomaría la nueva posición.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es decir:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; inoremap ; \
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;lograría lo que en este caso se quisiera. Cada vez que la tecla &lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt; se presione, la &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; tomará su lugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De la misma manera, cuando se especifica el anterior comando en el fichero de inicialización, conlleva a especificar el mismo comando, es decir &lt;code&gt;inoremap&lt;/code&gt; pero en esta ocasión con los símbolos de manera inversa. De otra manera, ambas teclas tendrán asignadas el mismo mapa en el registro del teclado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por lo tanto&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;inoremap \ ; 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sería imprescindible para finalizar la modificación de estas teclas.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reemplazos en Vim</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazos-en-vim/</link>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2016 14:42:55 EST</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/reemplazos-en-vim/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Estos son algunos de los reemplazos que se pudieran realizar en vim:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:s/\zs/\r/g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will have this string of characters: abcdefghi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tendrá esta cadena de caracteres: abcdefghi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a&lt;br&gt;
b&lt;br&gt;
c&lt;br&gt;
d&lt;br&gt;
e&lt;br&gt;
f&lt;br&gt;
g&lt;br&gt;
h&lt;br&gt;
i&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por otra parte la siguiente ejecución:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:s/\s/\r/g 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will have&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;esto es una prueba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;esto&lt;br&gt;
es&lt;br&gt;
una&lt;br&gt;
prueba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and &lt;code&gt;:s/\n//g&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will have something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a&lt;br&gt;
b&lt;br&gt;
c&lt;br&gt;
d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;results&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;abcde&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;:s/\n/ /g
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;will have something like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;esto&lt;br&gt;
es&lt;br&gt;
una&lt;br&gt;
prueba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;result&lt;/strong&gt;: esto es una prueba&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;por supuesto, se puede ver que en algunos casos se utiliza &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;, mientras que en otros se utiliza &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt;, es necesario recordar que en cada reemplazo y substitución en vim, se logra mediante &lt;code&gt;:s/texto para reemplazar/substituir con&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primero antes que todo el delimitador de barra oblicua &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; es la separación de lo que se quiere modificar con lo que se modificaría.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Es decir, por ejemplo, donde &lt;code&gt;texto para reemplazar&lt;/code&gt; es la expresión regular que se desea cambiar, o los caracteres del texto que se desean modificar, mientras que &lt;code&gt;substituir con&lt;/code&gt; es el nuevo ingreso que tomará lugar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En este caso, para entender este procedimiento, no hay mejor ayuda en vim, que ir directo a la documentación con &lt;code&gt;:help \n&lt;/code&gt; o mediante &lt;code&gt;:h \n&lt;/code&gt; para abreviar, y también entender el por qué difiere de &lt;code&gt;:help \r&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creo que una de las mejores respuestas sobre esto, se encuentra en &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/a/18961239&#34;&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/a/18961239&lt;/a&gt; que especifica que “in the syntax &lt;code&gt;s/foo/bar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; have different meanings depending on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En nuestro caso sería &lt;code&gt;s/texto para reemplazar/substituir con&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por lo tanto esto equivaldría a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el caso de &lt;code&gt;texto para reemplazar&lt;/code&gt;, es decir, &lt;code&gt;s/&amp;lt;texto para reemplazar&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; antes del segundo delimitador &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; sería una newline  o un salto de línea.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; en este caso sería CR que es la tecla &lt;code&gt;Enter&lt;/code&gt;, tecla de retorno o de regreso.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el caso de &lt;code&gt;substituir con&lt;/code&gt;, es decir, &lt;code&gt;s/&amp;lt;texto para reemplazar&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;substituir con&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, o los caracteres que se encuentren después de la segunda barra &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; seria un octeto nulo&lt;br&gt;
&lt;code&gt;\r&lt;/code&gt; en este caso es una &lt;code&gt;newline&lt;/code&gt; o un salto de línea.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Hugo No Sincroniza Directorio Estatico en Github</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/hugo-no-sincroniza-directorio-estatico-en-github/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 10 Sep 2016 10:09:44 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/hugo-no-sincroniza-directorio-estatico-en-github/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Después de realizar varias pruebas donde traté de evaluar algún que otro theme en Hugo, me di cuenta que el problema era más serio que lo pensaba.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenía en mente llevar las pruebas con ciertos temas minimalistas, o como se diría en español: simples, que me permitiesen llevar a cabo flexibles modificaciones locales., y de ahí partir con ello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La mayoría de los temas en Hugo están constituidos por ciertos paquetes de láminas en estilo de cascadas, o con las siglas en inglés por CSS, y al igual que otros pequeños ficheros en Javascript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabe aclarar que la mayoría, por no decir todos, emplean las últimas tecnologías en gráficos que validen la convención estándar establecida por el consorcio W3C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Les recomiendo a todos aquellos que estén interesados en generadores estáticos del web, que evalúen a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; title=&#34;Hugo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; y de ahí decidir si es o no el motor más eficiente y fiable que hace uso de estas últimas tecnologías. Por supuesto que no sería justo si no se menciona otros como &lt;a href=&#34;https://hexo.io/&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;hexo&lt;/a&gt;, desarrollado en Javascript por ejemplo, que al igual que el primero, son motores que valen la pena en emplearlos en la producción de sitios web, en la elaboración de blogs, al igual que con cualquier otra documentación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El motor &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, fue desarrollado en golang - un lenguaje de programación que fue creado en Google - es uno de los más recientes en este campo de generadores estáticos que ha sido recibido con mucho interés por programadores y otros entusiastas en computación. Pero sobre esto hablaré en otro artículo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Como dije al principio, en esta ocasión me interesaba más la flexible estructuración del blog que más que nada, mediante la evaluación de algunos de los &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;temas&lt;/a&gt; que están disponibles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le había hecho algunos que otros cambios a uno de ellos intitulado purehugo y basado mayormente en &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bootstrapCDN&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;bootstrapCDN&lt;/a&gt; logré llevar a cabo algunos que otros cambios, me mortificaba la idea que no podía omitir la generación de todos los posts en la raíz del servidor. Por mucho que traté de hacer los cambios, la creación de una página que no sería mostrada en la página principal del servidor, era casi imposible. Tampoco quería emplear más tiempo que el necesario en lograr esto.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decidí entonces en descargar una plantilla temática que lleva de nombre &lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/shiori/&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;shiori&lt;/a&gt;, que fue portado o transferido de la implementación original del tema del mismo nombre por su autor Shusaku Uesugi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estaba tratando de implementar en la estructura de la página un tema sencillo y este susodicho tema mostraba llenar los requisitos para ello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después de descargarlo en el directorio &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ git clone https://github.com/chibicode/hugo-theme-shiori shiori
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;decidí en ponerlo en práctica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ hugo server -t shiori 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;y el servidor local en el ordenador mostraba sin problemas la paginación correcta, al igual que todos los posts. No intenté en llevar otros cambios de modificación, porque la primera vez que ejecuté &lt;code&gt;hugo new post/test&lt;/code&gt; que proseguiría con la creación de un post en el archivo de contenido, un error acerca del fichero &lt;code&gt;archetypes&lt;/code&gt; se había generado.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traté de encontrar más información acerca de ello. Pero la única explicación acerca de esto tenía que ver con la actualización no solo de &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt; sino de todas las dependencias de este:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;go get -u -v github.com/spf13/hugo
github.com/spf13/hugo (download)
github.com/fsnotify/fsnotify (download)
Fetching https://golang.org/x/sys/unix?go-get=1
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El servidor local me mostraba las modificaciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una búsqueda más tarde en Google me refirió a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13/hugo/issues/1802&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iHugo 0.16-DEV (Jan 2016) fails to sync theme’s static directory on Linux&lt;/a&gt; el cual trataba este problema.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aparentemente una de las dependencias tenía que ser actualizada, y por lo tanto la bandera &lt;code&gt;-u&lt;/code&gt; tenía que ser especificada apropiadamente para la instalación del motor &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34; target=&#34;blank&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Flechas en Gimp</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/flechas-en-gimp/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2016 14:16:59 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/flechas-en-gimp/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Una de las maneras más fáciles en crear &lt;strong&gt;flechas&lt;/strong&gt; en Gimp, sería con la adición de un plugin al directorio &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; de Gimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En el sitio de &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/44797/how-do-i-insert-arrows-into-a-picture-in-gimp&#34;&gt;https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/44797/how-do-i-insert-arrows-into-a-picture-in-gimp&lt;/a&gt; se puede encontrar más información en cuanto a esto. Solamente mostraré los pasos visuales para lograrlo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $cd /directorio-de-gimp/scripts/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seguido de&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $wget http://registry.gimp.org/files/arrow.scm
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or the archived version &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $wget https://web.archive.org/web/20180218220954/http://registry.gimp.org:80/node/20269 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También pudieras hacer uso de una versión modificada del anterior script pero con flechas curvadas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;puedes obtenerlo mediante&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; $wget https://web.archive.org/web/20180208191139/http://registry.gimp.org:80/node/28566&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Y recomienza el programa Gimp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digamos por ejemplo, que seleccionas un nuevo documento. En la caja de herramientas de Gimp (recuerda que si no está visible, siempre puedes activarla a través de la combinación en el teclado de &lt;code&gt;Ctrl&lt;/code&gt; y &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;), podrás ver la nueva inclusión de la ventana de herramienta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veamos como funciona con la selección de esta misma caja de herramientas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/selecciona-toolbox.png&#34; alt=&#34;caja de herramientas toolbox&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El próximo paso sería seleccionar el icono con el que se marcan los dos puntos de la flecha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asegúrate que el color como se muestra en la figura anterior, esté seleccionado apropiadamente en la caja de herramientas (toolbox).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que los dos puntos hayan sido marcados, selecciona la barra del menú principal de &lt;code&gt;Herramientas/tools&lt;/code&gt;, descendiendo hasta el final y dándole clic a &lt;code&gt;Arrows&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que le des a &lt;code&gt;Arrows&lt;/code&gt; del menú principal de la barra, una ventana que es similar a la que se muestra a continuación te permitirá especificar ciertos valores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/select-tools-arrow.png&#34; alt=&#34;selecciona el menú principal de arrows&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que tengas la ventana abierta, ajusta los valores de porcentajes según el grosor, o el ancho que los ángulos de la flecha debiesen tener cuando se le aplique el color configurado. También puedes especificar otros valores como en rellenar a todo color la punta de la flecha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clic &lt;code&gt;ok&lt;/code&gt; una vez que los valores sean los acordados.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a directory called &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt;. It contains a file called &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; that contains the text &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt; to set up &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; as a Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git add number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to add &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to the index. The index is a list of all the files that Git is keeping track of. It maps filenames to the content of the files. It now has the mapping &lt;code&gt;number.txt -&amp;gt; first&lt;/code&gt;. Running the add command has also added a blob object containing &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; to the Git object database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;main __reader_view_article_wrap_4270907014602854__&#34;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;(This essay is a companion piece to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/&#34;&gt;Gitlet&lt;/a&gt;, my implementation of Git in JavaScript.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine you have a directory called &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt;. It contains a file called &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; that contains the text &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git init&lt;/code&gt; to set up &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; as a Git repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git add number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to add &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to the index. The index is a list of all the files that Git is keeping track of. It maps filenames to the content of the files. It now has the mapping &lt;code&gt;number.txt -&amp;gt; first&lt;/code&gt;. Running the add command has also added a blob object containing &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; to the Git object database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git commit -m first&lt;/code&gt;. This does three things. First, it creates a tree object in the objects database. This object represents the list of items in the top level of the alpha directory. This object has a pointer to the &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt; blob object that was created when you ran &lt;code&gt;git add&lt;/code&gt;. Second, it creates a commit object that represents the version of the repository that you have just committed. This includes a pointer to the tree object. Third, it points the master branch at the new commit object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git clone . ../beta&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a new directory called &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt;. It initializes it as a Git repository. It copies the objects in the alpha objects database to the beta objects database. It points the master branch on beta at the commit object that the master branch points at on the alpha repository. It sets the index on beta to mirror the content of the first commit. It updates your files - &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; - to mirror the index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You move to the beta repository. You change the content of &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;second&lt;/code&gt;. You run &lt;code&gt;git add number.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;git commit -m second&lt;/code&gt;. The commit object that is created has a pointer to its parent, the first commit. The commit command points the master branch at the second commit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You move back to the alpha repository. You run &lt;code&gt;git remote add beta ../beta&lt;/code&gt;. This sets the beta repository as a remote repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git pull beta master&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the covers, this runs &lt;code&gt;git fetch beta master&lt;/code&gt;. This finds the objects for the second commit and copies them from the beta repository to the alpha repository. It points alpha’s record of beta’s master at the second commit object. It updates &lt;code&gt;FETCH_HEAD&lt;/code&gt; to show that the master branch was fetched from the beta repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the covers, the pull command runs &lt;code&gt;git merge FETCH_HEAD&lt;/code&gt;. This reads &lt;code&gt;FETCH_HEAD&lt;/code&gt;, which shows that the master branch on the beta repository was the most recently fetched branch. It gets the commit object that alpha’s record of beta’s master is pointing at. This is the second commit. The master branch on alpha is pointing at the first commit, which is the ancestor of the second commit. This means that, to complete the merge, the merge command can just point the master branch at the second commit. The merge command updates the index to mirror the contents of the second commit. It updates the working copy to mirror the index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git branch red&lt;/code&gt;. This creates a branch called &lt;code&gt;red&lt;/code&gt; that points at the second commit object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git checkout red&lt;/code&gt;. Before the checkout, &lt;code&gt;HEAD&lt;/code&gt; pointed at the master branch. It now points at the red branch. This makes the red branch the current branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You set the content of &lt;code&gt;number.txt&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;third&lt;/code&gt;, run &lt;code&gt;git add numbers.txt&lt;/code&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;git commit -m third&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You run &lt;code&gt;git push beta red&lt;/code&gt;. This finds the objects for the third commit and copies them from the alpha repository to the beta repository. It points the red branch on the beta repository at the third commit object, and that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(If you would like to learn about the internals of Git in detail, you can read my essay, &lt;a href=&#34;https://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/git-from-the-inside-out&#34;&gt;Git from the inside out&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Círculos en Gimp</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/circulos-en-gimp/</link>
        <pubDate>Wed, 03 Aug 2016 14:13:46 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/circulos-en-gimp/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Esto es solamente un recordatorio para realizar varias modificaciones a cualquier imagen en &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gimp.org/&#34;&gt;GNU  Gimp&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No soy un usuario de este programa, pero reconozco que como manipulador de gráficos e imágenes, es incomparable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hace un tiempo, recuerdo haber leído algo acerca de esto a través del blog de &lt;a href=&#34;http://alvinalexander.com/gimp/gimp-how-to-create-draw-circle-in-gimp-tutorial/&#34;&gt;Alvin Alexander&lt;/a&gt; que toca sobre la creación de círculos, elipses y demás.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algunos de los pasos los omitiré, porque algunos son innecesarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Primero crea una imagen, un nuevo documento, aunque por supuesto, que puedes abrir cualquier otra imagen &lt;code&gt;png&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jpeg&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;jpg&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Después en la caja de herramienta, selecciona el elipsis que te servirá para demarcar el trazo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/selectelilipse.png&#34; alt=&#34;Selecciona elipse&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dibuja el trazo del círculo&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/dibujaimagen.png&#34; alt=&#34;dibuja imagen&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Una vez realizado este círculo, dale a clic al menú de &lt;code&gt;Select&lt;/code&gt;, y desciende hasta que te encuentres con el &lt;code&gt;Border&lt;/code&gt; (borde).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;En la nueva ventana que aparece donde te especifica en seleccionar en pixels la dimensión de este borde, incrementa o disminuye estos pixels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/selectmenuborder.png&#34; alt=&#34;Selecciona el borde del Menú&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asegúrate que el color que tienes seleccionado en la caja de herramientas sea el correcto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clic en el menú de &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; desde la ventana principal de Gimp y selecciona &lt;code&gt;Fill with FG Color&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/círculocolor.png&#34; alt=&#34;Círculo después de fill with color&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Cambia Tu Contraseña en Gmail Y Google</title>
        <link>https://imfrom.github.io/post/cambia-tu-contrase%C3%B1a-en-gmail-y-google/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 02 Aug 2016 14:48:19 -0500</pubDate>
        <author></author>
        <guid>https://imfrom.github.io/post/cambia-tu-contrase%C3%B1a-en-gmail-y-google/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Toda la ayuda que se necesite acerca de GMail, y cualquier otro producto de Google, se puede obtener a través de la página de estos en &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/&#34;&gt;https://support.google.com/&lt;/a&gt; pero no obstante a ello, enumeraré algunos que otros pasos para recuperar la contraseña o clave, en caso que se haya extraviado o por cualquier otro motivo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estas son algunas imágenes que se mostrarán, si tienes el idioma seleccionado como Español, o castellano,  en tu navegador.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/111.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Example image&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Que como se explica en &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/41078?hl=es&#34;&gt;https://support.google.com/mail/answer/41078?hl=es&lt;/a&gt; puedes reiniciar tu sesión para restablecer otra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/7.png&#34; alt=&#34;inicia sesión&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Una vez que le des clic te dirigirá hacia un enlace que te preguntará con tres (3) opciones:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/555.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;inicio de sesión&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acto seguido a ello, seleccionas una de ellas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por ejemplo, si seleccionas la primera de estas, porque simplemente se te ha olvidado, te da la opción de ingresar el correo electrónico que normalmente utilizas para el inicio de la sesión.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/8.png&#34; alt=&#34;correo de inicio para gmail&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El próximo enlace te preguntará por la última clave que recuerdas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Le das clic a &lt;strong&gt;No lo sé&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/444.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;escribe lo que te recuerdas&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Después que ingreses tu correo electrónico, o cualquier otro método de verificación secundario: así sea mediante otro correo electrónico, o mediante SMS de mensaje de texto, que empleaste durante el registro de la cuenta, Google te enviará un enlace, un link, que te permitirá restablecer otra contraseña.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recuerda en clic &lt;strong&gt;Continuar&lt;/strong&gt; para que el proceso comience, o de lo contrario la recuperación de la contraseña no será posible, según las actuales configuraciones que Google emplea para este proceso,  que requiere que se sigan los pasos como se muestra antes que Google te reenvíe otro email que te permita ingresar otra contraseña.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imfrom.github.io/images/99.png&#34; alt=&#34;clic continuar&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Si no tienes acceso al método de recuperación que especificaste, aún así, Google te permite verificar tu identidad mediante otras preguntas con respuestas que se utilizaron durante el registro de la cuenta.&lt;/p&gt;
